## Abstract

This study is anchored in the H2020 SEAMLESS project (https://www.seamlessproject.org, last access: 29 January 2024), which aims to develop ensemble assimilation methods to be implemented in Copernicus Marine Service monitoring and forecasting systems, in order to operationally estimate a set of targeted ecosystem indicators in various regions, including uncertainty estimates. In this paper, a simplified approach is introduced to perform a 4D (space–time) ensemble analysis describing the evolution of the ocean ecosystem. An example application is provided, which covers a limited time period in a limited subregion of the North Atlantic (between 31 and 21∘ W, between 44 and 50.5∘ N, between 15 March and 15 June 2019, at a ∘ and a 1 d resolution). The ensemble analysis is based on prior ensemble statistics from a stochastic NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean)–PISCES simulator. Ocean colour observations are used as constraints to condition the 4D prior probability distribution.

As compared to classic data assimilation, the simplification comes from the decoupling between the forward simulation using the complex modelling system and the update of the 4D ensemble to account for the observation constraint. The shortcomings and possible advantages of this approach for biogeochemical applications are discussed in the paper. The results show that it is possible to produce a multivariate ensemble analysis continuous in time and consistent with the observations. Furthermore, we study how the method can be used to extrapolate analyses calculated from past observations into the future. The resulting 4D ensemble statistical forecast is shown to contain valuable information about the evolution of the ecosystem for a few days after the last observation. However, as a result of the short decorrelation timescale in the prior ensemble, the spread of the ensemble forecast increases quickly with time. Throughout the paper, a special emphasis is given to discussing the statistical reliability of the solution.

Two different methods have been applied to perform this 4D statistical analysis and forecast: the analysis step of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (with domain localization) and a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) sampler (with covariance localization), both enhanced by the application of anamorphosis to the original variables. Despite being very different, the two algorithms produce very similar results, thus providing support to each other's estimates. As shown in the paper, the decoupling of the statistical analysis from the dynamical model allows us to restrict the analysis to a few selected variables and, at the same time, to produce estimates of additional ecological indicators (in our example: phenology, trophic efficiency, downward flux of particulate organic matter). This approach can easily be appended to existing operational systems to focus on dedicated users' requirements, at a small additional cost, as long as a reliable prior ensemble simulation is available. It can also serve as a baseline to compare with the dynamical ensemble forecast and as a possible substitute whenever useful.
