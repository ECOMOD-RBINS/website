    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change not only alters ocean physics and chemistry but also affects the biota. Larval dispersal patterns from spawning to nursery grounds and larval survival are driven by hydrodynamic processes and shaped by (a)biotic environmental factors. Therefore, it is important to understand the impacts of increased temperature rise and changes in wind speed and direction on larval drift and survival. We apply a particle-tracking model coupled to a 3D-hydrodynamic model of the English Channel and the North Sea to study the dispersal dynamics of the exploited flatfish (common) sole (Solea solea). We first assess model robustness and interannual variability in larval transport over the period 1995–2011. Then, using a subset of representative years (2003–2011), we investigate the impact of climate change on larval dispersal, connectivity patterns and recruitment at the nursery grounds. The impacts of five scenarios inspired by the 2040 projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are discussed and compared with interannual variability. The results suggest that 33% of the year-to-year recruitment variability is explained at a regional scale and that a 9-year period is sufficient to capture interannual variability in dispersal dynamics. In the scenario involving a temperature increase, early spawning and a wind change, the model predicts that (i) dispersal distance (+70%) and pelagic larval duration (+22%) will increase in response to the reduced temperature (−9%) experienced by early hatched larvae, (ii) larval recruitment at the nursery grounds will increase in some areas (36%) and decrease in others (−58%) and (iii) connectivity will show contrasting changes between areas. At the regional scale, our model predicts considerable changes in larval recruitment (+9%) and connectivity (retention −4% and seeding +37%) due to global change. All of these factors affect the distribution and productivity of sole and therefore the functioning of the demersal ecosystem and fisheries management."

    "text": "Summary\nFacing climate change is a societal challenge, and calls for ambitious, transformative, and collective action. To keep global warming below 2°C, we will need to rely on negative emission technologies (NETs). A promising NET approach is Enhanced Silicate Weathering (ESW). ESW makes use of the natural weathering reaction, whereby silicate dissolution consumes atmospheric CO2. DEHEAT will assess the efficiency of marine ESW in stimulating oceanic CO2 uptake by increasing alkalinity and evaluate its environmental impact, by applying an innovative fully integrated approach combining extensive field campaigns with state-of-the-art numerical models"

It focuses on analyzing the life cycle and distribution of shrimp in relation to environmental scenarios and their interactions with physical, chemical, and biological parameters, with the goal of developing a numerical model for resource optimization. The project also investigates the impact of sediment transport on the dynamics of the Cotonou channel mouth and its influence on tidal cycles and larval transport, while assessing potential management strategies. Additionally, it supports capacity building for women and identifies suitable zones for oyster aquaculture development. A comprehensive inventory and spatio-temporal analysis of phytoplankton in the coastal marine area will be conducted. Finally, the project emphasizes the dissemination of results within the scientific community and the sharing of findings with local stakeholders, including managers, municipalities, fishers, and local communities."

    "text": "Summary\nOUTFLOW will investigate how ocean sprawl, currently much related to the installation of offshore wind farms (OWFs), affects the organic matter (OM) dynamics at the local and regional scale. While OWFs are installed in an attempt to combat climate change (Priority 2), the presence of OWFs affects the potential of the local environment to support and preserve life (i.e. habitability) through the replacement of mobile sands with artificial hard structures resulting in the loss of habitat for soft-sediment organisms and gain for fouling organisms. The presence of the fouling fauna leads to a functional shift towards suspension feeding organisms and a subsequent alteration of the interactions between species and their environment (Priority 1), affecting carbon and nitrogen (Priority 1) cycling pathways. The fouling fauna filters a significant amount of water in search of food, hereby secreting faecal pellets (FP), which are deposited on the surrounding sea floor. Locally, this leads to imbalances in biogeochemical cycles (Priority 2) in the sediment, and altered faunal communities, to such extent that the altered sediments can act as a carbon sink (Priority 3) contributing as Blue Carbon reservoirs to mitigating climate change (Priority 2). Given the increasing effort to install OWFs in coastal areas in Europe and beyond, assessing cumulative effects on the ecological integrity (Priority 1) of the marine ecosystem at the regional scale requires upscaling of local changes to geographical scales that are relevant for managerial purposes."

    "text": "Summary\nRECAP\nCoastal environments provide valuable goods and services for society and are strongly affected by human activities. Globally, coastal waters represent over half of the ocean’s economic value (&gt;2500 billion USD annually). However, 70% of this production depends on the ocean’s health status, which is currently threatened by a plethora of anthropogenic perturbations. In particular, coastal environments suffer from the detrimental effects of these perturbations (e.g. hypoxia, acidification, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity and fish stocks losses). This alarming trend thus calls for urgent and efficient sustainable coastal management plans through ecosystem-based approaches as advised by EU legislations (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive, MSFD). Reaching this goal inevitably requires a better quantitative understanding of the complex forcings and the coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological process interplay that shape the structure and functioning of coastal ecosystems, as well as their resilience to anthropogenic perturbations. Coastal oceans, and more specifically the North Sea, are integral parts of the land-ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC). Understanding the structure and functioning of the North Sea, especially its response to projected global change, thus necessarily entails consideration of the entire continuum at different scales, from streams to the ocean. Furthermore, evaluating global change effects on ecosystem health and resilience is limited by our ability to capture the adaptive dynamics of coastal systems. Therefore, ReCAP aims at making a step change in analysing and predicting the evolution of the LOAC by developing the very first boundless model that represents the North Sea from shelf to its surrounding river-catchment network and from surface to sediment, as well as implementing improved process-based representations of ecosystem dynamics, resilience and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This innovative, boundless model will provide an integrated assessment of the coastal ecosystem response to changes in land-use/management, urbanization, river damming, atmospheric composition and climate at the North Sea LOAC scale.\nMore specifically, the resulting novel model framework, COHERENS_LOAC, will be used to:\n\nEstablish a Greenhouse Gas budget for the North Sea LOAC and evaluate its related socio-economic contribution;\nAssess the response of the North Sea LOAC to historical and projected global change in terms of ecosystem health and resilience, as well as socio-economic value.\n\nThe long-term, collaborative framework of the FED-tWIN program allows for such an ambitious model development and valorisation. It will ideally combine and further develop the expertise of the RBINS-ULB consortium to address a wide range of questions of high societal relevance at an unprecedented level of integration, detail and realism. It builds on past collaborations and capitalizes on the partners recent model developments, thus significantly mitigating risks. Furthermore, building on this innovative and unique observation, analysis and forecasting framework, the proposed FED-tWIN profile will be highly resilient and competitive, allowing for fast and efficient adaptation to emerging societal challenges and new funding opportunities. The exceptional framework of the program, which supports project development over a 10-year period will ideally place RBINS and ULB at the forefront of LOAC-coastal research worldwide and help develop new projects with high societal benefits at national and international scales."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNumerous fish populations show strong year-to-year variations in recruitment. The early life stages play a crucial role in determining recruitment and dispersal patterns. A helpful tool to understand recruitment and dispersal involves simulations with a Lagrangian transport model, which results from the coupling between a hydrodynamic model and an individual-based model. Larval transport models require sound knowledge of the biological processes governing larval dispersal, and they may be highly sensitive to the parameters selected. Various assumptions about larval traits, behaviour and other model parameters can be tested by comparing simulation results with field data to identify the most sensitive parameters and to improve model calibration. This study shows that biological parameterization is more important than inter-annual variability in explaining the year-to-year differences in larval recruitment of common sole in the North Sea and the eastern English Channel. In contrast, year-to-year variability of connectivity leads to higher variability than changes in the biological parameters. The most influential parameters are pelagic larval duration, spawning period and mortality. Calibration over a 12 yr recruitment survey shows that a scenario with low mortality associated with a long larval duration and behaviour involving nycthemeral and tidal migration best reproduces the observations. This research provides insights into factors influencing fish dispersal and recruitment, suggesting a strategy for enhancing the accuracy of models in upcoming studies. The study supports the improvement of larval dispersal modelling by incorporating an easily applicable sensitivity analysis for both calibration and validation. Incorporating sensitivity analyses enhances larval dispersal models, providing performing tools that can contribute to informed fisheries management and understanding of recruitment variability."
