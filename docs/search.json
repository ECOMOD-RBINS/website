    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nChannel networks are key to coastal wetland functioning and resilience under climate change. Vegetation affects sediment and hydrodynamics in many different ways, which calls for a coherent framework to explain how vegetation shapes channel network geometry and functioning. Here, we introduce an idealized model that shows how coastal wetland vegetation creates more complexly branching networks by increasing the ratio of channel incision versus topographic diffusion rates, thereby amplifying the channelization feedback that recursively incises finer-scale side-channels. This complexification trend qualitatively agrees with and provides an explanation for field data presented here as well as in earlier studies. Moreover, our model demonstrates that a stronger biogeomorphic feedback leads to higher and more densely vegetated marsh platforms and more extensive drainage networks. These findings may inspire future field research by raising the hypothesis that vegetation-induced self-organization enhances the storm surge buffering capacity of coastal wetlands and their resilience under sea-level rise."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTidal channels are essential morphological structures that mediate hydrological connectivity and maintain coastal resilience. Previous studies on vegetation-induced channel development primarily focused on the stages of initial establishment or later elaboration, characterized by slow and localized changes. However, the impact of rapid shifts in landscape vegetation on the initiation of tidal channels, such as main or tributary channels, remains poorly understood, particularly in micro-tidal system. In this study, we investigated this relationship through satellite imagery analysis and biogeomorphic modeling of a rapidly expanding micro-tidal marsh in the Yellow River Delta, China, which has experienced an invasion by Spartina alterniflora over the past decade. The satellite imagery demonstrated that Spartina alterniflora invasion has increased drainage density and reduced overland flow path length. Our modeling results showed that local flow acceleration between vegetation patches was insufficient to rapidly initiate channels under micro-tidal conditions. As the patchy marsh coalesced and expanded into a contiguously vegetated marsh, it altered landscape-scale flow patterns, diverting from homogenous platform flow to concentrated channel flow. This shift prominently promoted the initiation of tributary channels in the landward marsh zone. The simulated scenarios of vegetation removal highlighted a marked increase in flow divergence from adjacent platforms due to changes in landscape-scale vegetation configuration. This alteration in flow pattern amplified local hydrodynamics, consequently intensifying local channel incision. Our findings emphasize that the channel initiation is significantly influenced by landscape-scale vegetation configuration under micro-tidal conditions, beyond the localized interactions between plants and flow."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe COHERENS model is used to investigate the temporal and spatial variation of the coastal currents in 2021 at the Cat Ba - Ha Long, northern Vietnam. The findings indicate that tidal oscillation has a notable impact on the current fields in short-term variations (hours to days). Meanwhile, the wind field and river discharge are the decisive factors affecting the seasonal variation of the current fields in Cat Ba - Ha Long coastal area. Furthermore, the characteristics of residual currents are significantly affected by river discharges and wind patterns, which vary across different months and seasons. During the southwest monsoon season (May to August), the residual currents have a prevailing direction towards the sea, from the west and south-southwest towards the east and north-northeast, reaching maximum speeds of approximately 0.1–0.15 m/s. Conversely, in the transitional and northeast monsoon seasons, the directions of residual currents are from the east-northeast to the west-southwest, with peak speed up to 0.2–0.25 m/s. Notably, the residual currents in the bottom and surface layers in the eastern-southwestern area of Cat Ba Island and the north of Ha Long Bay are in opposite directions."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTidal marshes provide highly valued ecosystem services, which depend on variations in the geometric properties of the tidal channel networks dissecting marsh landscapes. The development and evolution of channel network properties are controlled by both abiotic (dynamic flow–landform feedbacks) and biotic processes (e.g. vegetation–flow–landform feedbacks). However, the relative role of biotic and abiotic processes, and under which condition one or the other is more dominant, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of spatio-temporal plant colonization patterns on tidal channel network development through flume experiments. Four scaled experiments mimicking tidal landscape development were conducted in a tidal flume facility: two control experiments without vegetation, a third experiment with hydrochorous vegetation colonization (i.e. seed dispersal via the tidal flow), and a fourth with patchy colonization (i.e. by direct seeding on the sediment bed). Our results show that more dense and efficient channel networks are found in the vegetation experiments, especially in the hydrochorous seeding experiment with slower vegetation colonization. Further, an interdependency between abiotic and biotic controls on channel development can be deduced. Whether biotic factors affect channel network development seems to depend on the force of the hydrodynamic energy and the stage of the system development. Vegetation–flow–landform feedbacks are only dominant in contributing to channel development in places where intermediate hydrodynamic energy levels occur and mainly have an impact during the transition phase from a bare to a vegetated landscape state. Overall, our findings suggest a zonal domination of abiotic processes at the seaward side of intertidal basins, while biotic processes have an additional effect on system development more towards the landward side."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntertidal wetlands, such as mangroves in the tropics, are increasingly recognized for their role in nature-based mitigation of coastal flood risks. Yet it is still poorly understood how effective they are at attenuating the propagation of extreme sea levels through large (order of 100 km2) estuarine or deltaic systems, with complex geometry formed by networks of branching channels intertwined with mangrove and intertidal flat areas. Here, we present a delta-scale hydrodynamic modelling study, aiming to explicitly account for these complex landforms, for the case of the Guayas delta (Ecuador), the largest estuarine system on the Pacific coast of Latin America. Despite coping with data scarcity, our model accurately reproduces the observed propagation of high water levels during a spring tide. Further, based on a model sensitivity analysis, we show that high water levels are most sensitive to the mangrove platform elevation and degree of channelization but to a much lesser extent to vegetation-induced friction. Mangroves with a lower surface elevation, lower vegetation density, and higher degree of channelization all favour a more efficient flooding of the mangroves and therefore more effectively attenuate the high water levels in the deltaic channels. Our findings indicate that vast areas of channelized mangrove forests, rather than densely vegetated forests, are most effective for nature-based flood risk mitigation in a river delta."

    "text": "Abstract\nDensely populated coastal river deltas are very vulnerable to compound flood risks coming from both oceanic and riverine sources. Climate change may increase these compound flood risks due to sea level rise and intensifying precipitation events. Here, we investigate to what extent nature-based flood defence strategies, through the conservation of mangroves in a tropical river delta, can contribute to mitigate the oceanic and riverine components of compound flood risks. While current knowledge of estuarine compound flood risks is mostly focussed on short-term events such as storm surges (taking 1 or a few days), longer-term events, such as El Niño events (continuing for several weeks to months) along the Pacific coast of Latin America, are less studied. Here, we present a hydrodynamic modelling study of a large river delta in Ecuador aiming to elucidate the compound effects of El Niño-driven oceanic and riverine forcing on extreme high water level propagation through the delta and, in particular, the role of mangroves in reducing the compound high water levels. Our results show that the deltaic high water level anomalies are predominantly driven by the oceanic forcing but that the riverine forcing causes the anomalies to amplify upstream. Furthermore, mangroves in the delta attenuate part of the oceanic contribution to the high water level anomalies, with the attenuating effect increasing in the landward direction, while mangroves have a negligible effect on the riverine component. These findings show that mangrove conservation and restoration programmes can contribute to nature-based mitigation, especially the oceanic component of compound flood risks in a tropical river delta."

    "text": "Summary\nFacing climate change is a societal challenge, and calls for ambitious, transformative, and collective action. To keep global warming below 2°C, we will need to rely on negative emission technologies (NETs). A promising NET approach is Enhanced Silicate Weathering (ESW). ESW makes use of the natural weathering reaction, whereby silicate dissolution consumes atmospheric CO2. DEHEAT will assess the efficiency of marine ESW in stimulating oceanic CO2 uptake by increasing alkalinity and evaluate its environmental impact, by applying an innovative fully integrated approach combining extensive field campaigns with state-of-the-art numerical models"

    "text": "Summary\nThe main objective of this project is to find a synergy between mariculture and passive fisheries, so that both activities can be combined with higher profits and other benefits. Especially to seek a WIN-WIN situation between these two activities, such as sharing an area closed for beam trawl fishing, shipping time, mooring installation, etc. In the long term this could increase the national consumption of marine resources in a sustainable manner, resulting in lower impact on the marine ecosystem and in a lower carbon or product foot print. The following research lines are set out in this project, each with its own SMART targets and deliverables:\n• New substrates and habitat enrichment: The project will identify efficient substrates to capture spat and dedicated biodegradable substrates for habitat enrichment. As there is no knowledge available of the effect of integrated multi trophic aquaculture and habitat enrichment, monitoring of macrobenthos and fishes is essential to quantify the effects. Therefore an effective monitoring program must be set up to evaluate the effects of mariculture and passive fisheries on the marine environment, as well as for parameters that influence the growth of target species and operations at sea. • Innovative passive fishing gears: Identification of the best functioning passive fishing gears for the existing conditions in the Belgian part of the North Sea and effective stimuli to increase the capture efficiency of passive fishing gear.\n• Concept of the North Sea seafarm of tomorrow: The project will evaluate all materials to ensure that the outcome is a North Sea proof production unit for farming bivalves and seaweed.\n• Sustainable multi-use and value chain of marine resources."

However, along with the socioeconomic development the water management of HLB became increasingly complicated. The water quality is rapidly declining; this reduces the attractiveness of HLB for tourists and threatens the sustainable development of the area. In the CLIMDIS project a 3D hydrodynamic model is used as a base to develop a toolkit that can be used to assess, forecast and monitor the water quality of the bay and provide real time information on dispersal trends of organic pollutants. A better understanding of the extent of the impact of pollutants and the effects of human activity and climate change on the water quality will help to better manage the health of the marine ecosystem of this area, to minimise the negative impact on the socioeconomic development of the region and to react adequately to rapid changes in the water and ecosystem quality of the region. All this serves the goals of sustainable development."

    "text": "Summary\nRECAP\nCoastal environments provide valuable goods and services for society and are strongly affected by human activities. Globally, coastal waters represent over half of the ocean’s economic value (&gt;2500 billion USD annually). However, 70% of this production depends on the ocean’s health status, which is currently threatened by a plethora of anthropogenic perturbations. In particular, coastal environments suffer from the detrimental effects of these perturbations (e.g. hypoxia, acidification, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity and fish stocks losses). This alarming trend thus calls for urgent and efficient sustainable coastal management plans through ecosystem-based approaches as advised by EU legislations (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive, MSFD). Reaching this goal inevitably requires a better quantitative understanding of the complex forcings and the coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological process interplay that shape the structure and functioning of coastal ecosystems, as well as their resilience to anthropogenic perturbations. Coastal oceans, and more specifically the North Sea, are integral parts of the land-ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC). Understanding the structure and functioning of the North Sea, especially its response to projected global change, thus necessarily entails consideration of the entire continuum at different scales, from streams to the ocean. Furthermore, evaluating global change effects on ecosystem health and resilience is limited by our ability to capture the adaptive dynamics of coastal systems. Therefore, ReCAP aims at making a step change in analysing and predicting the evolution of the LOAC by developing the very first boundless model that represents the North Sea from shelf to its surrounding river-catchment network and from surface to sediment, as well as implementing improved process-based representations of ecosystem dynamics, resilience and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This innovative, boundless model will provide an integrated assessment of the coastal ecosystem response to changes in land-use/management, urbanization, river damming, atmospheric composition and climate at the North Sea LOAC scale.\nMore specifically, the resulting novel model framework, COHERENS_LOAC, will be used to:\n\nEstablish a Greenhouse Gas budget for the North Sea LOAC and evaluate its related socio-economic contribution;\nAssess the response of the North Sea LOAC to historical and projected global change in terms of ecosystem health and resilience, as well as socio-economic value.\n\nThe long-term, collaborative framework of the FED-tWIN program allows for such an ambitious model development and valorisation. It will ideally combine and further develop the expertise of the RBINS-ULB consortium to address a wide range of questions of high societal relevance at an unprecedented level of integration, detail and realism. It builds on past collaborations and capitalizes on the partners recent model developments, thus significantly mitigating risks. Furthermore, building on this innovative and unique observation, analysis and forecasting framework, the proposed FED-tWIN profile will be highly resilient and competitive, allowing for fast and efficient adaptation to emerging societal challenges and new funding opportunities. The exceptional framework of the program, which supports project development over a 10-year period will ideally place RBINS and ULB at the forefront of LOAC-coastal research worldwide and help develop new projects with high societal benefits at national and international scales."

We will address knowledge gaps about (1) altered underwater light field, hydrodynamics, pelagic biogeochemistry and primary production, (2) the artificial habitat provision for colonizing fauna and fish, and (3) effects on carbon fluxes and sequestration. Advice for ecodesigning offshore PV installations, paving the way to its environmental licensing, will be formulated."

    "text": "Summary\nThe FORCOAST project addresses the topic “DT-SPACE-01-EO-2018-2020 COPERNICUS MARKET UPTAKE” which seeks to foster market development exploiting the value of Copernicus Earth Observation Products. FORCOAST aims to provide information services that offer high resolution water quality and met-ocean indicators in coastal and nearshore areas, to improve operation, planning and management of different marine activities in the sectors of wild fisheries, oystergrounds restoration, and bivalve mariculture. FORCOAST information products and services will be co-designed with stakeholders, thereby ensuring that these products and services are tailored to meet their needs. FORCOAST is developing, testing and demonstrating, in operational mode, novel Copernicus-based downstream information services that will incorporate Copernicus Marine, Land and Climate Services Products, local monitoring data and advanced modelling in the service. The services will integrate Copernicus Earth Observation Products with local models and other diverse data sources (local, regional or global) with ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web, and use of cloud) across the different market segments. FORCOAST will provide consistent coastal data products, based on a standardized data processing scheme. FORCOAST is supporting the concept of developing an advanced platform and cloud computing for Copernicus-based downstream services utilizing one of the DIAS systems. The availability and accessibility of data and derived products generated will stimulate their exploitation by a wide range of user communities in the targeted sectors. FORCOAST will provide those services in eight pilot service uptake sites covering five different regional waters (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and the coastal Atlantic Ocean)."

It focuses on analyzing the life cycle and distribution of shrimp in relation to environmental scenarios and their interactions with physical, chemical, and biological parameters, with the goal of developing a numerical model for resource optimization. The project also investigates the impact of sediment transport on the dynamics of the Cotonou channel mouth and its influence on tidal cycles and larval transport, while assessing potential management strategies. Additionally, it supports capacity building for women and identifies suitable zones for oyster aquaculture development. A comprehensive inventory and spatio-temporal analysis of phytoplankton in the coastal marine area will be conducted. Finally, the project emphasizes the dissemination of results within the scientific community and the sharing of findings with local stakeholders, including managers, municipalities, fishers, and local communities."

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Summary\nOUTFLOW will investigate how ocean sprawl, currently much related to the installation of offshore wind farms (OWFs), affects the organic matter (OM) dynamics at the local and regional scale. While OWFs are installed in an attempt to combat climate change (Priority 2), the presence of OWFs affects the potential of the local environment to support and preserve life (i.e. habitability) through the replacement of mobile sands with artificial hard structures resulting in the loss of habitat for soft-sediment organisms and gain for fouling organisms. The presence of the fouling fauna leads to a functional shift towards suspension feeding organisms and a subsequent alteration of the interactions between species and their environment (Priority 1), affecting carbon and nitrogen (Priority 1) cycling pathways. The fouling fauna filters a significant amount of water in search of food, hereby secreting faecal pellets (FP), which are deposited on the surrounding sea floor. Locally, this leads to imbalances in biogeochemical cycles (Priority 2) in the sediment, and altered faunal communities, to such extent that the altered sediments can act as a carbon sink (Priority 3) contributing as Blue Carbon reservoirs to mitigating climate change (Priority 2). Given the increasing effort to install OWFs in coastal areas in Europe and beyond, assessing cumulative effects on the ecological integrity (Priority 1) of the marine ecosystem at the regional scale requires upscaling of local changes to geographical scales that are relevant for managerial purposes."

    "text": "ECOMOD tasks and responsabilities\n\nTask 5.1 Gathering forcing data for the biogeochemical model.\n\nThe upscaling will require the collection of the necessary underlying data for the modelling, and will be done by re-using own data, by harvesting data from publicly available databases, data available through D.4.1.1 or model simulations. Deliverable 5.1.1. will be a collection of supporting data for further modelling efforts.\n\nTask 5.2 Upscaling at the North Sea scale\n\nBased on D.5.1.1, D.3.2.1. and data collected during Task 1.1., a spatial upscaling to the North Sea scale will be done by updating the biogeochemical model MIRO&CO to include filtration rates and FP production by the fouling fauna. The spatial information needed to run scenarios (gridded maps on OWF location with relevant information on future turbine dimensions and decommissioning scenarios) will be produced. Deliverable 5.2.1. will be an updated version of MIRO & CO (Month 45); D.5.2.2. comprises the gridded maps underpinning the scenario runs.\n\nTask 5.3 Simulations\n\nBased on the updated MIRO & CO version (D.5.2.1) and the relevant spatial information (D.5.2.2.), the possible redistribution of OM at the scale of the North Sea will be estimated. In addition, taking into account the data on Blue Carbon potential generated through D.4.2.1, the Blue Carbon potential of the North Sea sediments will be assessed. Deliverable 5.3.3. will be a mapping of the rearrangement of sedimentary carbon pools at the scale of the North Sea, as a consequence of the current and expected OWFs and different decommissioning scenarios."

Pauline’s research focuses on modelling the environmental impacts of offshore renewable marine energy infrastructures, particularly floating solar panels within offshore wind farms in the the North Sea. On one hand, she specializes in hydrodynamic modelling, given her background in physics, to study aspects such as current fields and turbulence. On the other hand, she also investigates the biogeochemical processes that solar structures may induce, including bio-colonization, fecal pellet deposition, carbon enrichment of the seabed, sediment dynamics, and benthos equilibrium.\nPauline recently started her PhD in collaboration with Ghent University, supervised by Arthur Capet and Jan Vanaverbeke (from MARECO team).\nPauline enjoys organizing events within the team and at RBINS, and loves traveling to present her research at various conferences.\n\nExperience\n\nGhent University | Ghent, Belgium PhD Student | 2024-Current\nRoyal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences | Brussels, Belgium Scientific collaborator | 2022-Current\nRoyal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences | Brussels, Belgium Master student intern | 2022-2022\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nToulon University | Toulon, France MSc Oceanography | 2020-2022\nUMONS | Mons, Belgium BSc Physics | 2017-2020"

The model is validated with respect to water levels, sea currents, temperature and salinity during 2017. Validation for astronomical tides showed that the model is able to simulate observed tidal elevation and phases for both diurnal and semi-diurnal principal constituents with a consistent level of agreement at measurement station. A statistical analysis of the results showed that the correlation coefficient and skill index between the modelled and observed tidal elevations are both above 0.96 with an average RMSE of 9 cm. The atmospheric contribution to water levels was also validated. In this case, we observe a good agreement between modelled and measured water levels with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and an average RMSE of 1.23 cm. The validation of spatial distribution and vertical evolution of zonal current, salinity and temperature also indicated a high model accuracy for these variables. Overall, we show that our model of the Gulf of Guinea leads to highly accurate simulations, providing a basis for further fundamental and applied research studies in the area."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNumerous fish populations show strong year-to-year variations in recruitment. The early life stages play a crucial role in determining recruitment and dispersal patterns. A helpful tool to understand recruitment and dispersal involves simulations with a Lagrangian transport model, which results from the coupling between a hydrodynamic model and an individual-based model. Larval transport models require sound knowledge of the biological processes governing larval dispersal, and they may be highly sensitive to the parameters selected. Various assumptions about larval traits, behaviour and other model parameters can be tested by comparing simulation results with field data to identify the most sensitive parameters and to improve model calibration. This study shows that biological parameterization is more important than inter-annual variability in explaining the year-to-year differences in larval recruitment of common sole in the North Sea and the eastern English Channel. In contrast, year-to-year variability of connectivity leads to higher variability than changes in the biological parameters. The most influential parameters are pelagic larval duration, spawning period and mortality. Calibration over a 12 yr recruitment survey shows that a scenario with low mortality associated with a long larval duration and behaviour involving nycthemeral and tidal migration best reproduces the observations. This research provides insights into factors influencing fish dispersal and recruitment, suggesting a strategy for enhancing the accuracy of models in upcoming studies. The study supports the improvement of larval dispersal modelling by incorporating an easily applicable sensitivity analysis for both calibration and validation. Incorporating sensitivity analyses enhances larval dispersal models, providing performing tools that can contribute to informed fisheries management and understanding of recruitment variability."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nCoastal salt marshes and their valuable ecosystem services are vulnerable to degradation due to rising sea levels, to which they can adapt through biogeomorphic feedbacks. However, the invasion of plant species, particularly eco-engineering species that alter these interactions, may degrade the structural integrity and functionality of salt marshes, potentially reducing their resilience to sea-level rise. Such impacts presently remain poorly understood. Focusing on coastal marshes of China, we utilized a coupled biogeomorphic model to explore the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion versus native Suaeda salsa on coastal geomorphology, considering different sea-level rise and tidal scenarios. Our results revealed that Spartina alterniflora invasion contributed to the formation of a “levee-basin” geomorphological structure at both the landscape scale (from seaward to landward zones) and the local scale (from channel fringes to marsh interiors). This pattern led to a prominent marsh depression, particularly in “basin” areas under microtidal conditions, indicating increased vulnerability to rising sea levels in invaded systems. Additionally, the proliferation of Spartina alterniflora could completely displace Suaeda salsa. Our findings emphasize the importance of controlling plant invasion to safeguard ecosystem resilience to environmental change."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTo save saltmarshes and their valuable ecosystem services from sea level rise, it is crucial to understand their natural ability to gain elevation by sediment accretion. In that context, a widely accepted paradigm is that dense vegetation favors sediment accretion and hence saltmarsh resilience to sea level rise. Here, however, we reveal how dense vegetation can inhibit sediment accretion on saltmarsh platforms. Using a process-based modeling approach to simulate biogeomorphic development of typical saltmarsh landscapes, we identify two key mechanisms by which vegetation hinders sediment transport from tidal channels toward saltmarsh interiors. First, vegetation concentrates tidal flow and sediment transport inside channels, reducing sediment supply to platforms. Second, vegetation enhances sediment deposition near channels, limiting sediment availability for platform interiors. Our findings suggest that the resilience of saltmarshes to sea level rise may be more limited than previously thought.\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of stem density (top) and bed elevation (bottom) for dense Spartina marshes (left), sparse Salicornia marshes (middle), and unvegetated mudflats (right).

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change not only alters ocean physics and chemistry but also affects the biota. Larval dispersal patterns from spawning to nursery grounds and larval survival are driven by hydrodynamic processes and shaped by (a)biotic environmental factors. Therefore, it is important to understand the impacts of increased temperature rise and changes in wind speed and direction on larval drift and survival. We apply a particle-tracking model coupled to a 3D-hydrodynamic model of the English Channel and the North Sea to study the dispersal dynamics of the exploited flatfish (common) sole (Solea solea). We first assess model robustness and interannual variability in larval transport over the period 1995–2011. Then, using a subset of representative years (2003–2011), we investigate the impact of climate change on larval dispersal, connectivity patterns and recruitment at the nursery grounds. The impacts of five scenarios inspired by the 2040 projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are discussed and compared with interannual variability. The results suggest that 33% of the year-to-year recruitment variability is explained at a regional scale and that a 9-year period is sufficient to capture interannual variability in dispersal dynamics. In the scenario involving a temperature increase, early spawning and a wind change, the model predicts that (i) dispersal distance (+70%) and pelagic larval duration (+22%) will increase in response to the reduced temperature (−9%) experienced by early hatched larvae, (ii) larval recruitment at the nursery grounds will increase in some areas (36%) and decrease in others (−58%) and (iii) connectivity will show contrasting changes between areas. At the regional scale, our model predicts considerable changes in larval recruitment (+9%) and connectivity (retention −4% and seeding +37%) due to global change. All of these factors affect the distribution and productivity of sole and therefore the functioning of the demersal ecosystem and fisheries management."

    "text": "Abstract\nPlanting has been widely adopted to battle the loss of salt marshes and to establish living shorelines. However, the drivers of success in salt marsh planting and their ecological effects are poorly understood at the global scale. Here, we assemble a global database, encompassing 22,074 observations reported in 210 studies, to examine the drivers and impacts of salt marsh planting. We show that, on average, 53% of plantings survived globally, and plant survival and growth can be enhanced by careful design of sites, species selection, and novel planted technologies. Planting enhances shoreline protection, primary productivity, soil carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and fishery production (effect sizes = 0.61, 1.55, 0.21, 0.10 and 1.01, respectively), compared with degraded wetlands. However, the ecosystem services of planted marshes, except for shoreline protection, have not yet fully recovered compared with natural wetlands (effect size = −0.25, 95% CI −0.29, −0.22). Fortunately, the levels of most ecological functions related to climate change mitigation and biodiversity increase with plantation age when compared with natural wetlands, and achieve equivalence to natural wetlands after 5–25 years. Overall, our results suggest that salt marsh planting could be used as a strategy to enhance shoreline protection, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration."
