    "text": "Abstract\nSeveral reasons, from stakeholder conflicts to water quality issues, are pushing bivalve cultivation to less accessible, exposed, and offshore waters. Because sheltered areas are absent along the Belgian coastline, the possibility to culture mussels with self-regulated systems in exposed conditions has been explored by various research projects. Farmers consider offshore environments unsuitable on the assumption that spat densities are low, and growth is insufficient for commercialization. This study evaluates the potential for self-regulated mussel cultivation in an exposed North Sea environment based on data collected from several research projects that evaluated the biological and technical feasibility of commercial longline cultivation in Belgium. The cultivation methods were variable, but always relied on wild spat that was grown to market size. No husbandry practices such as seed harvesting, thinning, grading, or socking were performed. This cultivation technique, also called self-regulating cultivation, reduces operational costs when extreme weather and exposed conditions limit handling. A 3D hydro-dynamic larvae dispersal model (LDM) was used to simulate the spatial variability in arrivals and the timing of the arrival peak. In addition, a locally validated metabolic model (DEB) for the blue mussel (M. edulis) was forced with 10 year optimized remote sensing observations (Copernicus, Sentinel-3/OLCI) to predict industry-relevant information such as site suitability, inter-annual growth variability, and cultivation time. This study concludes that exposed mussel cultivation near the Belgian east coast is characterised by fast growth. Mussels grown in this area will reach a marketable size (6 cm) after 12–15 months of cultivation, which is just in time for the peak consumption season (July-August). Moving offshore prolongs the cultivation cycles to 17–25 months, but provides more stable growth conditions with less inter-annual variability. When considering a cultivation period of 12 months, the mussels originating from offshore cultivation are comparable in size to the smaller Dutch “Smitse” and French “Bouchots”."

    "text": "Abstract\nTidal marshes provide highly valued ecosystem services, which depend on variations in the geometric properties of the tidal channel networks dissecting marsh landscapes. The development and evolution of channel network properties are controlled by both abiotic (dynamic flow–landform feedbacks) and biotic processes (e.g. vegetation–flow–landform feedbacks). However, the relative role of biotic and abiotic processes, and under which condition one or the other is more dominant, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of spatio-temporal plant colonization patterns on tidal channel network development through flume experiments. Four scaled experiments mimicking tidal landscape development were conducted in a tidal flume facility: two control experiments without vegetation, a third experiment with hydrochorous vegetation colonization (i.e. seed dispersal via the tidal flow), and a fourth with patchy colonization (i.e. by direct seeding on the sediment bed). Our results show that more dense and efficient channel networks are found in the vegetation experiments, especially in the hydrochorous seeding experiment with slower vegetation colonization. Further, an interdependency between abiotic and biotic controls on channel development can be deduced. Whether biotic factors affect channel network development seems to depend on the force of the hydrodynamic energy and the stage of the system development. Vegetation–flow–landform feedbacks are only dominant in contributing to channel development in places where intermediate hydrodynamic energy levels occur and mainly have an impact during the transition phase from a bare to a vegetated landscape state. Overall, our findings suggest a zonal domination of abiotic processes at the seaward side of intertidal basins, while biotic processes have an additional effect on system development more towards the landward side."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study is anchored in the H2020 SEAMLESS project (https://www.seamlessproject.org, last access: 29 January 2024), which aims to develop ensemble assimilation methods to be implemented in Copernicus Marine Service monitoring and forecasting systems, in order to operationally estimate a set of targeted ecosystem indicators in various regions, including uncertainty estimates. In this paper, a simplified approach is introduced to perform a 4D (space–time) ensemble analysis describing the evolution of the ocean ecosystem. An example application is provided, which covers a limited time period in a limited subregion of the North Atlantic (between 31 and 21∘ W, between 44 and 50.5∘ N, between 15 March and 15 June 2019, at a ∘ and a 1 d resolution). The ensemble analysis is based on prior ensemble statistics from a stochastic NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean)–PISCES simulator. Ocean colour observations are used as constraints to condition the 4D prior probability distribution.\nAs compared to classic data assimilation, the simplification comes from the decoupling between the forward simulation using the complex modelling system and the update of the 4D ensemble to account for the observation constraint. The shortcomings and possible advantages of this approach for biogeochemical applications are discussed in the paper. The results show that it is possible to produce a multivariate ensemble analysis continuous in time and consistent with the observations. Furthermore, we study how the method can be used to extrapolate analyses calculated from past observations into the future. The resulting 4D ensemble statistical forecast is shown to contain valuable information about the evolution of the ecosystem for a few days after the last observation. However, as a result of the short decorrelation timescale in the prior ensemble, the spread of the ensemble forecast increases quickly with time. Throughout the paper, a special emphasis is given to discussing the statistical reliability of the solution.\nTwo different methods have been applied to perform this 4D statistical analysis and forecast: the analysis step of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (with domain localization) and a Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) sampler (with covariance localization), both enhanced by the application of anamorphosis to the original variables. Despite being very different, the two algorithms produce very similar results, thus providing support to each other’s estimates. As shown in the paper, the decoupling of the statistical analysis from the dynamical model allows us to restrict the analysis to a few selected variables and, at the same time, to produce estimates of additional ecological indicators (in our example: phenology, trophic efficiency, downward flux of particulate organic matter). This approach can easily be appended to existing operational systems to focus on dedicated users’ requirements, at a small additional cost, as long as a reliable prior ensemble simulation is available. It can also serve as a baseline to compare with the dynamical ensemble forecast and as a possible substitute whenever useful."

To properly address physical, dynamical, ice, and biogeochemical processes, numerical strategies must be employed. The authors provide an outlook on the status of operational ocean forecasting systems in eight key regions including the global ocean: the West Pacific and Marginal Seas of South and East Asia, the Indian Seas, the African Seas, the Mediterranean and Black Sea, the North East Atlantic, South and Central America, North America (including the Canadian coastal region, the United States, and Mexico), and the Arctic.\nThe authors initiate their discussion by addressing the specific regional challenges that must be addressed and proceed to discuss the numerical strategy and the available operational systems, ranging from regional to coastal scales. This compendium serves as a foundational reference for understanding the global offering, demonstrating how the diverse physical environment – ranging from waves to ice – and the biogeochemical features besides ocean dynamics can be systematically addressed through regular, coordinated prediction efforts."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe expected increase of maritime activities in the North Sea and the growing awareness of its natural environmental value require enhanced science-based environmental advice for more efficient and effective marine management. The North Sea Open Science Conference organised by the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and the Belgian Biodiversity Platform in 2016 aimed to take stock of the present-day scientific knowledge on the North Sea ecosystem, its interactions with human activities and its management. The conference was structured along three themes: (1) ‘the scientific backbone of the North Sea ecosystem: adequacy of the knowledge base?’, (2) ‘A new era in environmental monitoring and assessment: what is at stake?’, and (3) ‘Sustainability: one for all, all for one?’. Focusing on ‘open science’, we welcomed about 200 participants from around the North Sea with different backgrounds and interests in environmental sciences. The participants were challenged to reflect on current and future challenges for the North Sea management and, in particular, to explore possible nature-friendly solutions for addressing these challenges during a series of introductory oral (69) and poster (59) presentations, and World Café and Fish Bowl participatory sessions. The participants agreed on six main actions to (1) provide a solid scientific base for marine management decisions; (2) develop society-driven research; (3) increase interdisciplinary science; (4) recognise the need for system knowledge; (5) improve communication, knowledge exchange, and collective implementation of scientific knowledge; and (6) build integrated knowledge bases. For each of these, concrete action points were identified, and this review gives the most important and relevant ones for creating the knowledge base and managerial framework for a sustainable North Sea."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTidal channels are essential morphological structures that mediate hydrological connectivity and maintain coastal resilience. Previous studies on vegetation-induced channel development primarily focused on the stages of initial establishment or later elaboration, characterized by slow and localized changes. However, the impact of rapid shifts in landscape vegetation on the initiation of tidal channels, such as main or tributary channels, remains poorly understood, particularly in micro-tidal system. In this study, we investigated this relationship through satellite imagery analysis and biogeomorphic modeling of a rapidly expanding micro-tidal marsh in the Yellow River Delta, China, which has experienced an invasion by Spartina alterniflora over the past decade. The satellite imagery demonstrated that Spartina alterniflora invasion has increased drainage density and reduced overland flow path length. Our modeling results showed that local flow acceleration between vegetation patches was insufficient to rapidly initiate channels under micro-tidal conditions. As the patchy marsh coalesced and expanded into a contiguously vegetated marsh, it altered landscape-scale flow patterns, diverting from homogenous platform flow to concentrated channel flow. This shift prominently promoted the initiation of tributary channels in the landward marsh zone. The simulated scenarios of vegetation removal highlighted a marked increase in flow divergence from adjacent platforms due to changes in landscape-scale vegetation configuration. This alteration in flow pattern amplified local hydrodynamics, consequently intensifying local channel incision. Our findings emphasize that the channel initiation is significantly influenced by landscape-scale vegetation configuration under micro-tidal conditions, beyond the localized interactions between plants and flow."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe pre-eutrophic state of marine waters is generally not well known, complicating target setting for management measures to combat eutrophication. We present results from an OSPAR ICG-EMO model assessment to simulate the pre-eutrophic state of North-East Atlantic marine waters. Using an ecosystem model ensemble combined with an observation-based weighting method we derive sophisticated estimates for key eutrophication indicators. Eight modelling centres applied the same riverine nutrient loads, atmospheric nutrient deposition rates and boundary conditions to their specific model set-up to ensure comparability. The pre-eutrophic state was defined as a historic scenario of estimated nutrient inputs (riverine, atmospheric) at around the year 1900, before the invention and widespread use of industrial fertilizers. The period 2009-2014 was used by all participants to simulate both the current state of eutrophication and the pre-eutrophic scenario, to ensure that differences are solely due to the changes in nutrient inputs between the scenarios. Mean values were reported for winter dissolved inorganic nutrients and total nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) and the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, and for growing season chlorophyll, chlorophyll 90th percentile, near-bed oxygen minimum and net phytoplankton production on the level of the OSPAR assessment areas. Results showed distinctly lower nutrient concentrations and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio’s in coastal areas under pre-eutrophic conditions compared to current conditions (except in the Meuse Plume and Seine Plume areas). Chlorophyll concentrations were estimated to be as much as ~40% lower in some areas, as were dissolved inorganic phosphorus levels. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen levels were found to be up to 60% lower in certain assessment areas. The weighted average approach reduced model disparities, and delivered pre-eutrophic concentrations in each assessment area. Our results open the possibility to establish reference values for indicators of eutrophication across marine regions. The use of the new assessment areas ensures local ecosystem functioning is better represented while political boundaries are largely ignored. As such, the reference values are less associated to member states boundaries than to ecosystem boundaries."

    "text": "Abstract\nAim The Western Antarctic Peninsula is challenged by climate change and increasing maritime traffic that together facilitate the introduction of marine non-native species from warmer regions neighbouring the Southern Ocean. Ballast water exchange has been frequently reported as an introduction vector. This study uses a Lagrangian approach to model the passive drift of virtual propagules departing from Ballast water hypothetic exchange zones, at contrasting distances from the coasts.\nLocation Western Antarctic Peninsula.\nMethods Virtual propagules were released over the 2008–2016 period and at three distances from the nearest coasts: 200 (convention for the management of Ballast Water, 2004), 50 or 11 nautical miles (NM).\nResults Results show that exchanging Ballast water at 200 NM considerably reduces the arrival of propagules in proposed marine protected areas of the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. On the eastern side, propagules can reach north-eastern marine protected areas within a few days due to strong currents for all tested scenarios. Seasonal and yearly variations indicate that exceptional climate events could influence the trajectory of particles in the region. Ballast water should be exchanged at least 200 NM offshore on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and avoided on the eastern side to limit particle arrival in proposed marine protected areas. Focusing on Deception Island, our results suggested that the Patagonian crab (Halicarcinus planatus) observed in 2010 could have been introduced in case of Ballast water exchange at 50 NM or less from the coast.\nMain conclusions This study highlights the importance of respecting Ballast water exchange convention to limit the risk of non-native species introduction. Ballast water exchange should be operated at least at 200 NM from the coasts, which further limits particle arrival in shallow water areas. This is especially important in the context of a more visited and warmer Southern Ocean."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe purpose of this work was to investigate the physical and chemical dynamics of Lake Nokoué for its efficient management. For this purpose, two sampling campaigns per month from five stations (North, South, Central, East and West) were conducted for a period of one year (November 2020 to November 2021). Physic and chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, depth, water transparency, pH, dissolved oxygen and total dissolved solids) were measured and wet substrate samples were collected to study the granulometry. Data analysis revealed that Lake Nokoué is mainly affected by two regimes: flooding and low water. Flooding, which is not directly related to rainfall, did not begin until one month after the major rainy season in June. The sources that contributed to the flooding of Lake Nokoué were the freshwater tributaries coming mainly from the Ouèmé River and the flow of the Sô River from August to November. The inflow of fresh water contributed to the decrease in salinity and transparency of the lake from the east to the south. During the low water period (from December to July), Lake Nokoué is characterized by an increase in salinity and transparency from the south to the northeast due to the massive intrusion of sea water into the lake. The highest dissolved oxygen levels are observed in the south and center (5.92 ± 0.46 mg/L) while it varies greatly in the north and west (Eichhornia crassipes concentration zone) during flooding. The average annual depth of Lake Nokoué was 1.47 ± 0.66 m with an average annual pH of 6.85 ± 0.56."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nConnectivity and dispersal are important factors for ecosystem dynamics, conservation, and resource management. Dispersal and recruitment success are determined in early life for many marine species. For those larvae that are pelagic, transport from spawning to nursery grounds is driven by hydrodynamic processes. Other environmental factors such as temperature and biological factors such as ecophysiology, behavior, and reproductive strategy (spawning period and spawning grounds) influence the final dispersal pattern and larval survival. We utilized a Lagrangian particle tracking model coupled with a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Larvae&Co) to assess the connectivity patterns between spawning and nursery grounds of six commercially exploited flatfish species in the North Sea over a 10-yr period (1997–2006). Standardized analyses have highlighted how spawning and nursery grounds are connected under the combined pressure of environment and life-history traits. Results showed that the six flatfishes can be divided in two groups, each with their specific connectivity patterns. Turbot, common sole, and brill live in two subpopulations in the North Sea; common dab, European flounder, and European plaice represent a single mixed population. In general, the modeled and genetic patterns match, hence showing the strong impact of larval connectivity. The large overlap in connectivity for species that spawn during the same period and the seasonal change in hydrodynamics highlight the strong impact of a summer front in larval dispersal. Our results prove that individual-based modeling is a powerful tool to guide resource management, even in cases of limited biological information."

    "text": "Abstract\nMarine sand and gravel extraction alters seabed structure and biodiversity, but recovery dynamics after cessation remain less understood. This study investigates the recovery of macrobenthic communities and morpho-sedimentary characteristics in two areas after cessation of aggregate extraction in a tidal sandbank environment. By combining long-term monitoring data, including multibeam echosounder surveys and grab sampling, we assessed recovery trajectories over up to eight years post-extraction. Our findings highlight that while extraction-induced depressions persist without infill, biological and physical recovery begin almost immediately post-extraction, driven by local sediment reorganization and colonization by opportunistic species. The extent of recovery depends on time elapsed; total benthic abundance, biomass, and species composition deviated strongly from reference conditions at the time of cessation but gradually started to reflect those over time. After eight years, a return to reference conditions is observed. We hypothesize that seabed enrichment with coarse materials through screening during extraction facilitated recovery via the hiding-exposure mechanism. While recovery is evident, we do observe some site-specific variations between the two studied areas influenced by differences in sediment composition, hydrodynamics, and extraction intensity. As such, it is important to recognise that site-specific variability in both environmental conditions and extraction operations may limit transferability to other regions. Moreover, full restoration to pre-extraction conditions may not always be achievable. Instead, new stable ecosystem states, approximating reference conditions, could serve as alternative recovery benchmarks. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive management strategies tailored to the recovery potential of dynamic sandy environments."

Furthermore, the characteristics of residual currents are significantly affected by river discharges and wind patterns, which vary across different months and seasons. During the southwest monsoon season (May to August), the residual currents have a prevailing direction towards the sea, from the west and south-southwest towards the east and north-northeast, reaching maximum speeds of approximately 0.1–0.15 m/s. Conversely, in the transitional and northeast monsoon seasons, the directions of residual currents are from the east-northeast to the west-southwest, with peak speed up to 0.2–0.25 m/s. Notably, the residual currents in the bottom and surface layers in the eastern-southwestern area of Cat Ba Island and the north of Ha Long Bay are in opposite directions."

Our data demonstrate that biophysical flocculation cannot be explained by these heterogeneous parameters, but requires a distinction between a more reactive labile (“fresh”) and a less reactive refractory (“mineral-associated”) fraction. Based on all data, we separated the labile and mineral-associated POC, PON, and TEP using a semi-empirical model approach. The model’s estimates of fresh and mineral-associated organic matter (OM) show that great parts of the POC, PON, and TEP are associated with suspended minerals, which are present in the water column throughout the year, whereas the occurrence of fresh TEP, POC, and PON is restricted to spring and summer months. In spite of a constantly high abundance of total TEP throughout the entire year, it is its fresh fraction that promotes the formation of larger and faster sinking biomineral flocs, thereby contributing to reducing the SPM concentration in the water column over spring and summer. Our results show that the different components of the SPM, such as minerals, extracellular OM and living organisms, form an integrated dynamic system with direct interactions and feedback controls."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nTo save saltmarshes and their valuable ecosystem services from sea level rise, it is crucial to understand their natural ability to gain elevation by sediment accretion. In that context, a widely accepted paradigm is that dense vegetation favors sediment accretion and hence saltmarsh resilience to sea level rise. Here, however, we reveal how dense vegetation can inhibit sediment accretion on saltmarsh platforms. Using a process-based modeling approach to simulate biogeomorphic development of typical saltmarsh landscapes, we identify two key mechanisms by which vegetation hinders sediment transport from tidal channels toward saltmarsh interiors. First, vegetation concentrates tidal flow and sediment transport inside channels, reducing sediment supply to platforms. Second, vegetation enhances sediment deposition near channels, limiting sediment availability for platform interiors. Our findings suggest that the resilience of saltmarshes to sea level rise may be more limited than previously thought.\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of stem density (top) and bed elevation (bottom) for dense Spartina marshes (left), sparse Salicornia marshes (middle), and unvegetated mudflats (right).

    "text": "Abstract\nSince 1950, increase in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) river loadings in the North-East Atlantic (NEA) continental seas has induced a deep change in the marine coastal ecosystems, leading to eutrophication symptoms in some areas. In order to recover a Good Ecological Status (GES) in the NEA, as required by European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), reductions in N- and P-river loadings are necessary but they need to be minimal due to their economic impact on the farming industry. In the frame of the “EMoSEM” European project, we used two marine 3D ecological models (ECO-MARS3D, MIRO&CO) covering the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the southern North Sea to estimate the contributions of various sources (riverine, oceanic and atmospheric) to the winter nitrate and phosphate marine concentrations. The various distributed descriptors provided by the simulations allowed also to find a log-linear relationship between the 90th percentile of satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations and the “fully bioavailable” nutrients, i.e. simulated nutrient concentrations weighted by light and stoichiometric limitation factors. Any GES threshold on the 90th percentile of marine chlorophyll concentration can then be translated in maximum admissible ‘fully bioavailable’ DIN and DIP concentrations, from which an iterative linear optimization method can compute river-specific minimal abatements of N and P loadings. The method has been applied to four major river groups, assuming either a conservative (8 μg Chl L−1) or a more socially acceptable (15 μg Chl L−1) GES chlorophyll concentration threshold. In the conservative case, maximum admissible winter concentrations for nutrients correspond to marine background values, whereas in the lenient case, they are close to values recommended by the WFD/MSFD. Both models suggest that to reach chlorophyll GES, strong reductions of DIN and DIP are required in the Eastern French and Belgian-Dutch river groups."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe export of shrimps to the European Union was one of the mainstays of the Beninese economy. It is an income-generating activity for the populations living along Lake Nokoué. The lack of a fisheries management strategy has caused a drastic decline in shrimp’s production in Lake Nokoué since 2003. To remedy this problem, it is necessary to hypothesize on their spatial-temporal dynamics in the Lake Nokoué-Cotonou channel complex. This is investigated by combining a literature review on their life cycles and habitat suitability with spatial-temporal evolution of salinity obtained from in-situ observations. The literature review reported four (04) potential families of shrimp species whose part of their life cycle is common to the ecology of Lake Nokoué: Penaeidae (Penaeus); Palaemonidae (Macrobrachium); Atyidae (Atya) and Desmocarididae (Desmocaris). The overall results in relation to the life cycle of the shrimp species indicate that adults of the Macrobrachium, Atya species have a favorable environment in Lake Nokoué from August to November and their larvae must remain in the lake from December to June to ensure their survival. The species of the genus Desmocaris, which carry out their entire life cycle in fresh water, can stay in Lake Nokoué from August to November. The species of the genus Penaeus have a favorable environment in Lake Nokoué from December to June but their larvae can only survive in the sea. Species of the genus Caridina (freshwater) and Palaemon (estuary and marine) belonging to the family Palaemonidae can however be found in Lake Nokoué because of their wide distribution on the West African coast although they are not reported in Benin. This research makes it possible to predict the presence or absence of shrimp genera in a lake system, based on their life cycle. Based on the results obtained, we suggest a ban on fishing in Lake Nokoué between December and February and a ban on shrimp fishing in the Cotonou canal for a good management of the shrimp stock in Benin."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction: European and member state legislation encourage the sustainable development of offshore environments, with the restoration or creation of flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) habitats offering potential solutions to enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. The site selection and identification of suitable habitats for flat oyster habitat restoration projects remains a significant knowledge gap.\nMethods: By combining seabed substrate information with a coupled population (Dynamic Energy Budget - Individual-Based Models) and particle tracking model (for larvae dispersal), critical insights can be gained into the spatial distribution of suitability indicators such as population growth, fitness, reproduction, and self-recruitment. By applying this model to the English Channel and the North Sea over a ten-year period, suitable locations for flat oyster habitat restoration, restorative aquaculture, or oyster-related nature-inclusive designs can be identified. Comparing historical oyster bed locations with model outputs offers insights into why these locations were suitable for oyster bed development and allows for validation of the proposed approach.\nResults and discussion: Coastal and nearshore environments are generally more suitable for flat oyster habitat restoration, and populations will grow more quickly in these areas. Offshore restoration in the North Sea presents challenges if it relies solely on self-recruitment. Besides site selection purposes, the model can be used to evaluate the effect of management strategies (e.g., initial population size) or environmental pressures (e.g., climate change, pollution) on restorations success."

    "text": "Abstract\nIdentifying the mechanisms that contribute to the variability of suspended particulate matter concentrations in coastal areas is important but difficult, especially due to the complexity of physical and biogeochemical interactions involved. Our study addresses this complexity and investigates changes in the horizontal spread and composition of particles, focusing on cross-coastal gradients in the southern North Sea and the English Channel. A semi-empirical model is applied on in situ data of SPM and its organic fraction to resolve the relationship between organic and inorganic suspended particles. The derived equations are applied onto remote sensing products of SPM concentration, which provide monthly synoptic maps of particulate organic matter concentrations (here, particulate organic nitrogen) at the surface together with their labile and less reactive fractions. Comparing these fractions of particulate organic matter reveals their characteristic features along the coastal-offshore gradient, with an area of increased settling rate for particles generally observed between 5 and 30 km from the coast. We identify this area as the transition zone between coastal and offshore waters with respect to particle dynamics. Presumably, in that area, the turbulence range and particle composition favor particle settling, while hydrodynamic processes tend to transport particles of the seabed back towards the coast. Bathymetry plays an important role in controlling the range of turbulent dissipation energy values in the water column, and we observe that the transition zone in the southern North Sea is generally confined to water depths below 20 m. Seasonal variations in suspended particle dynamics are linked to biological processes enhancing particle flocculation, which do not affect the location of the transition zone. We identify the criteria that allow a transition zone and discuss the cases where it is not observed in the domain. The impact of these particle dynamics on coastal carbon storage and export is discussed."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe aim of this work was to characterize the growth and reproduction dynamics of shrimp in the Lac Nokoué-Chenal de Cotonou complex. The results of one year’s sampling from five stations (North, South, East, Central and West) of the lagoon complex revealed that linear growth in size in Lake Nokoué is decreasing over time in Macrobrachium macrobrachion (the most representative species of the genus Macrobrachium), but positive in Penaeus notialis (the most representative species of the genus Penaeus). Size-weight relationships indicate that the lowest growth coefficient (b=1.56) is obtained in immature males of Macrobrachium felicinum, while the highest growth coefficient (b=3.39) is obtained in mature females of Macrobrachium vollenhovenii, with an average of 2.84 for all shrimp species over both sexes considered. The χ2 test indicated that only the species Macrobrachium vollenhovenii has a significant sexual imbalance in favour of females in Lake Nokoué. Fisher’s Least Significant Difference test indicated that the estimated first sexual maturity sizes in Macrobrachium vollenhovenii and M. macrobrachion are significantly different from those estimated in M. felicinum at the α=0.05 threshold. However, the same test indicates that there is not enough evidence to differentiate the sizes of first sexual maturation in M. vollenhovenii and M. macrobrachion. This work revealed that Penaeus monodon was the only species to show better positive growth within all its groups in Lake Nokoué while exposed to anthropogenic effects. A gradual average increase in the size of Penaeus notialis in Lake Nokoué is found between the beginning and end of the saline intrusion (which confirms the life cycle of the species presented). Species of the genus Macrobrachium showed good reproductive capacity, with the absence of sexually mature Penaeus in this lagoon."

    "text": "Summary\nRECAP\nCoastal environments provide valuable goods and services for society and are strongly affected by human activities. Globally, coastal waters represent over half of the ocean’s economic value (&gt;2500 billion USD annually). However, 70% of this production depends on the ocean’s health status, which is currently threatened by a plethora of anthropogenic perturbations. In particular, coastal environments suffer from the detrimental effects of these perturbations (e.g. hypoxia, acidification, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity and fish stocks losses). This alarming trend thus calls for urgent and efficient sustainable coastal management plans through ecosystem-based approaches as advised by EU legislations (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive, MSFD). Reaching this goal inevitably requires a better quantitative understanding of the complex forcings and the coupled physical-biogeochemical-ecological process interplay that shape the structure and functioning of coastal ecosystems, as well as their resilience to anthropogenic perturbations. Coastal oceans, and more specifically the North Sea, are integral parts of the land-ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC). Understanding the structure and functioning of the North Sea, especially its response to projected global change, thus necessarily entails consideration of the entire continuum at different scales, from streams to the ocean. Furthermore, evaluating global change effects on ecosystem health and resilience is limited by our ability to capture the adaptive dynamics of coastal systems. Therefore, ReCAP aims at making a step change in analysing and predicting the evolution of the LOAC by developing the very first boundless model that represents the North Sea from shelf to its surrounding river-catchment network and from surface to sediment, as well as implementing improved process-based representations of ecosystem dynamics, resilience and adaptation to changing environmental conditions. This innovative, boundless model will provide an integrated assessment of the coastal ecosystem response to changes in land-use/management, urbanization, river damming, atmospheric composition and climate at the North Sea LOAC scale.\nMore specifically, the resulting novel model framework, COHERENS_LOAC, will be used to:\n\nEstablish a Greenhouse Gas budget for the North Sea LOAC and evaluate its related socio-economic contribution;\nAssess the response of the North Sea LOAC to historical and projected global change in terms of ecosystem health and resilience, as well as socio-economic value.\n\nThe long-term, collaborative framework of the FED-tWIN program allows for such an ambitious model development and valorisation. It will ideally combine and further develop the expertise of the RBINS-ULB consortium to address a wide range of questions of high societal relevance at an unprecedented level of integration, detail and realism. It builds on past collaborations and capitalizes on the partners recent model developments, thus significantly mitigating risks. Furthermore, building on this innovative and unique observation, analysis and forecasting framework, the proposed FED-tWIN profile will be highly resilient and competitive, allowing for fast and efficient adaptation to emerging societal challenges and new funding opportunities. The exceptional framework of the program, which supports project development over a 10-year period will ideally place RBINS and ULB at the forefront of LOAC-coastal research worldwide and help develop new projects with high societal benefits at national and international scales."

We will address knowledge gaps about (1) altered underwater light field, hydrodynamics, pelagic biogeochemistry and primary production, (2) the artificial habitat provision for colonizing fauna and fish, and (3) effects on carbon fluxes and sequestration. Advice for ecodesigning offshore PV installations, paving the way to its environmental licensing, will be formulated."

    "text": "Summary\nOUTFLOW will investigate how ocean sprawl, currently much related to the installation of offshore wind farms (OWFs), affects the organic matter (OM) dynamics at the local and regional scale. While OWFs are installed in an attempt to combat climate change (Priority 2), the presence of OWFs affects the potential of the local environment to support and preserve life (i.e. habitability) through the replacement of mobile sands with artificial hard structures resulting in the loss of habitat for soft-sediment organisms and gain for fouling organisms. The presence of the fouling fauna leads to a functional shift towards suspension feeding organisms and a subsequent alteration of the interactions between species and their environment (Priority 1), affecting carbon and nitrogen (Priority 1) cycling pathways. The fouling fauna filters a significant amount of water in search of food, hereby secreting faecal pellets (FP), which are deposited on the surrounding sea floor. Locally, this leads to imbalances in biogeochemical cycles (Priority 2) in the sediment, and altered faunal communities, to such extent that the altered sediments can act as a carbon sink (Priority 3) contributing as Blue Carbon reservoirs to mitigating climate change (Priority 2). Given the increasing effort to install OWFs in coastal areas in Europe and beyond, assessing cumulative effects on the ecological integrity (Priority 1) of the marine ecosystem at the regional scale requires upscaling of local changes to geographical scales that are relevant for managerial purposes."

Deliverable 5.1.1. will be a collection of supporting data for further modelling efforts.\n\nTask 5.2 Upscaling at the North Sea scale\n\nBased on D.5.1.1, D.3.2.1. and data collected during Task 1.1., a spatial upscaling to the North Sea scale will be done by updating the biogeochemical model MIRO&CO to include filtration rates and FP production by the fouling fauna. The spatial information needed to run scenarios (gridded maps on OWF location with relevant information on future turbine dimensions and decommissioning scenarios) will be produced. Deliverable 5.2.1. will be an updated version of MIRO & CO (Month 45); D.5.2.2. comprises the gridded maps underpinning the scenario runs.\n\nTask 5.3 Simulations\n\nBased on the updated MIRO & CO version (D.5.2.1) and the relevant spatial information (D.5.2.2.), the possible redistribution of OM at the scale of the North Sea will be estimated. In addition, taking into account the data on Blue Carbon potential generated through D.4.2.1, the Blue Carbon potential of the North Sea sediments will be assessed. Deliverable 5.3.3. will be a mapping of the rearrangement of sedimentary carbon pools at the scale of the North Sea, as a consequence of the current and expected OWFs and different decommissioning scenarios."

It focuses on analyzing the life cycle and distribution of shrimp in relation to environmental scenarios and their interactions with physical, chemical, and biological parameters, with the goal of developing a numerical model for resource optimization. The project also investigates the impact of sediment transport on the dynamics of the Cotonou channel mouth and its influence on tidal cycles and larval transport, while assessing potential management strategies. Additionally, it supports capacity building for women and identifies suitable zones for oyster aquaculture development. A comprehensive inventory and spatio-temporal analysis of phytoplankton in the coastal marine area will be conducted. Finally, the project emphasizes the dissemination of results within the scientific community and the sharing of findings with local stakeholders, including managers, municipalities, fishers, and local communities."

    "text": "Summary\nThe aim of SWiM is to conduct research on the combination of marine technologies in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Belgium, in particular to integrate Offshore Floating Photovoltaics (OFPV) in wind farms. The six partners of SWiM will model the performance as a function of environmental variables, assess the limits to electricity generation imposed by the cables to shore, work out criteria for the mooring and anchoring, define rules for the placement and evaluate potential environmental impacts. Workshops with stakeholders will be held to derive policy advice."

    "section": "Biography",
    "text": "Biography\nMy master thesis, in physics, was an attempt to describe the behavior of cellular automata through the lens of information theory. Since then, I have devoted myself to the study of marine ecosystems using data analysis and ecological modelling. My PhD thesis, dedicated to the Black Sea, has been praised for its inter-disciplinarity and relevance for managerial concerns. After a series of postdoctoral experiences in oceanography (Spain, Italy, Belgium, and France), I’m currently holding a FedTwin cross-insitutional postion between the academic research team BGEOSYS at Université Libre de Bruxelles and the public research team ECOMOD at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. My current objective is to building a task force within and accross these teams, focused on the study of ecosystem dynamics accross the Land-Ocean Continuum (RECAP).\n\nMarine models\nThrough past commitments, I had the opportunity to use and contribute to the development of a large variety of marine modelling tools addressing the hydrodynamics, benthic and pelagic biogeochemistry components, and their connection with high trophic levels and societal stakes. These models were deployed in 3D, 1D, and Lagrangian settings, to address process studies, sensitivity analyses, long-term hindcast (production and analyses), operational forecasts and downstream service production, all of which involve a specific set of validation protocols.\nAt ECOMOD, I now coordinate the development of the biogeochemical module of COHERENS, where our first achievement has been to ensure a compatibility module between COHERENS and FABM.\nAt BGEOSYS, I coordinate the technical developments of CGEM, a 1D estuarine model resolving the biogeochemical exchanges and transformation processes at the interface between the land and marine domains.\n\n\nData Analysis\nThe conditioning, calibration, and validation of these models provided me with a good overview of the various datasets and monitoring tools relevant to marine and coastal dynamics. In general, I favour in my works to evidence phenomena from observations before employing models to describe underlying mechanisms. During my PhD, while working on the simulation of Black Sea oxygen dynamics, I applied a detrending methodology (Capet et al, 2014, Ocean Science) on datasets of various nature, and revealed an impressive decline in the oxygen inventory of the Black Sea over the last decades (Capet et al, 2016, Biogeosciences). Later, by combining model and in situ time series (1955-2020), I related this trend to a warming-induced shift in the ventilation regime of the Black Sea (Capet et al. 2020, Biogeosciences). From these works, I proposed an Ocean Monitoring Index to keep track of this trend for the Copernicus Marine Service. During the master thesis of my colleague Florian Ricour, we used BGC-Argo to characterise the morphology of the Deep-Chlorophyll Maximum in the Black Sea (Ricour, Capet, et al., Biogeosciences, 2021)\nBesides, I was introduced to remote-sensing altimetry and oceanic mesoscale dynamics during my first postdoc (IMEDEA, Spain; Capet, et al. 2014, Geophysical Research Letters). More recently, in the frame of an ESA project, I have combined altimetry and Argo profiles to assess the subsurface oxygen imprint of Black Sea (Capet, et al. 2022).\nIn an ongoing framework set in Lake Nokoue, Benin, we attempt to use in-situ species characterization of phytoplancton groups with multi and hyper spectral ocean color datasets, to infer the spatial and seasonal distribution of toxic algaes, and provide managment support for this ecosystem.\n\n\nCoastal oceanography\nMy concern for societal issues quickly draw me to the coastal environment that concentrates high stakes and dependencies, and its specific modelling challenges. A clear limitation of marine models appeared when addressing benthic hypoxia in coastal shelves (Capet et al. 2014, Biogeosciences): too often, the representation of dissolved and particulate fluxes at the sediment-water interface largely over-simplify diagenetic processes. After having implemented an efficient approach towards benthic dynamics in the Black Sea (Capet et al, 2016, Ocean Modelling), I obtained a Marie-Curie grant (OGS, Italy) for application in the Mediterranean Sea and joined with Pr. K. Soetaert (NIOZ, the Netherlands) to automatize the calibration of diagenetic models. I then applied this method to relate sediment core data to functional ‘facies’ of benthic communities. These facies provided a convenient way to introduce spatial variation of bioturbation (solid-phase mixing induced by dwelling) and bioirrigation (dissolved exchanges induced by ventilation) in coupled models. Benthic-pelagic coupling remains an active research line, now oriented to North Sea sediments and the challenge of deriving a umbrella modelling framework adequate for both permeable and non-permeable sediments.\nAn important part of my activities in the North Sea gravitates around offshore renewable energies, which started for me with FACE-IT (2016-20), where I co-supervised a PhD evaluating the impact of offshore windfarms on sediment dynamics in the North Sea. Since then, I’ve joined the ICES Working Group on Marine and Benthal Renewable Developments ICES_WGMBRED, suggsting ways to progress on the question “How do Offshore wind farms impact coastal ecosystem services”. I proposed a semi-quantitative framework to synthesise expert opinions on the links between pressures, organisms, functions, and services (Diamond Diagram). I’m now active with different degrees of involvement in RBINS research dedicated to the environmental impact of solar and wind offshore renewable energy (MarineSPOTS, ECOMPV, SWIM), most often with colleagues from MARECO.\n\n\nApplied and operational oceanography\nI’ve for long be in touch with the Copernicus Marine Service community, among others through the Marine Forecasting Center for the Black Sea, that was ensured by my former group at ULiège.\nIn 2018, I joined the foundation of the EuroGOOS Coastal Working Group (CWG, which I now co-chair with G. El Serafy), and conducted the first systematic survey questioning the capacity of European operational models towards coastal phenomena (Capet et al, 2020, Frontiers in Marine Science). The CWG now collaborates with the OceanForecast Decade Collaborative Center, to pursue this exercice in the frame of their Atlas of Ocean Operational Forecasting Systems."

    "text": "Summary\nZERO-IMPACT aims to develop an innovative, sustainable and automatic method to detect marine species based on ‘environmental’ DNA (eDNA). The project is a methodological study that is hands-on with concrete applications for biodiversity monitoring, marine fisheries and aquaculture, in particular: - supporting stock estimates of commercial fish species - more accurate delineation of spawning periods of commercial fish species and splash fall periods of marine animals - detection of toxic algae and harmful parasites in relation to marine shellfish culture - monitoring biodiversity (animals and phytoplankton) in support of science and policy (achieving Good Environmental Status according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, Directive 2008/56 /EC) and Natura 2000 conservation objectives)\nStudying marine species and biodiversity using eDNA is complementary to traditional methods and at the same time offers huge advantages: 1/ by collecting water to detect the presence of species, the organisms themselves are not disturbed or killed, 2/ studying different organisms (fish, invertebrates, plankton) can be done based on only one sampling method and 3/ continuous time series for marine biodiversity and fish populations can be obtained through automatic sampling of seawater."

    "text": "Summary\nExploiting the ecosystem services of the World Natural Heritage of Ha Long Bay (HLB, North Vietnam) to develop tourism has contributed greatly to the socioeconomic development of Quang Ninh province. However, along with the socioeconomic development the water management of HLB became increasingly complicated. The water quality is rapidly declining; this reduces the attractiveness of HLB for tourists and threatens the sustainable development of the area. In the CLIMDIS project a 3D hydrodynamic model is used as a base to develop a toolkit that can be used to assess, forecast and monitor the water quality of the bay and provide real time information on dispersal trends of organic pollutants. A better understanding of the extent of the impact of pollutants and the effects of human activity and climate change on the water quality will help to better manage the health of the marine ecosystem of this area, to minimise the negative impact on the socioeconomic development of the region and to react adequately to rapid changes in the water and ecosystem quality of the region. All this serves the goals of sustainable development."

    "text": "Summary\nSEA-UNICORN brings together a broad, inter-disciplinary community of scientists, marine stakeholders and policy-makers, from more than 100 organizations spread around the world, in order to advance knowledge and unify concepts and approaches in the emerging field of Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC). SEA-UNICORN scientists will share their complementary expertise to identify knowledge gaps in the field of MFC, and integrate information gained from a wide range of tools such as genetics, remote sensing / telemetry, morphological analyses, and dispersal modelling. Inputs from theoreticians, ecosystem modellers, and conservation scientists, but also from marine policy-makers and resource or ecosystem managers in the network, will also contribute to advance concepts and methods in MFC science. Our common aim is to improve knowledge on MFC and facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the projection models and decision support tools used for decision-taking in marine policy and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme of the connectivity pattern between the ICES management units as predicted by the dispersal model.

    "text": "Summary\nThe main objective of this project is to find a synergy between mariculture and passive fisheries, so that both activities can be combined with higher profits and other benefits. Especially to seek a WIN-WIN situation between these two activities, such as sharing an area closed for beam trawl fishing, shipping time, mooring installation, etc. In the long term this could increase the national consumption of marine resources in a sustainable manner, resulting in lower impact on the marine ecosystem and in a lower carbon or product foot print. The following research lines are set out in this project, each with its own SMART targets and deliverables:\n• New substrates and habitat enrichment: The project will identify efficient substrates to capture spat and dedicated biodegradable substrates for habitat enrichment. As there is no knowledge available of the effect of integrated multi trophic aquaculture and habitat enrichment, monitoring of macrobenthos and fishes is essential to quantify the effects. Therefore an effective monitoring program must be set up to evaluate the effects of mariculture and passive fisheries on the marine environment, as well as for parameters that influence the growth of target species and operations at sea. • Innovative passive fishing gears: Identification of the best functioning passive fishing gears for the existing conditions in the Belgian part of the North Sea and effective stimuli to increase the capture efficiency of passive fishing gear.\n• Concept of the North Sea seafarm of tomorrow: The project will evaluate all materials to ensure that the outcome is a North Sea proof production unit for farming bivalves and seaweed.\n• Sustainable multi-use and value chain of marine resources."

In addition, science-based knowledge and advice is provided which is essential for policymakers while negotiating fishing quota from 2026 onwards."

FORCOAST aims to provide information services that offer high resolution water quality and met-ocean indicators in coastal and nearshore areas, to improve operation, planning and management of different marine activities in the sectors of wild fisheries, oystergrounds restoration, and bivalve mariculture. FORCOAST information products and services will be co-designed with stakeholders, thereby ensuring that these products and services are tailored to meet their needs. FORCOAST is developing, testing and demonstrating, in operational mode, novel Copernicus-based downstream information services that will incorporate Copernicus Marine, Land and Climate Services Products, local monitoring data and advanced modelling in the service. The services will integrate Copernicus Earth Observation Products with local models and other diverse data sources (local, regional or global) with ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web, and use of cloud) across the different market segments. FORCOAST will provide consistent coastal data products, based on a standardized data processing scheme. FORCOAST is supporting the concept of developing an advanced platform and cloud computing for Copernicus-based downstream services utilizing one of the DIAS systems. The availability and accessibility of data and derived products generated will stimulate their exploitation by a wide range of user communities in the targeted sectors. FORCOAST will provide those services in eight pilot service uptake sites covering five different regional waters (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and the coastal Atlantic Ocean)."

    "text": "Summary\nUnderstanding marine ecosystem impacts amid complex ocean dynamics is vital for monitoring ocean health but remains challenging. The EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) promotes a coordinated, precautionary approach to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) using 11 ecosystem descriptors. Traditional linear and threshold-based assessments have proven insufficient. Recent efforts like the S4GES (2022) and BIOTREC-Tara (2024) cruises tested innovative, process-based, multi-platform monitoring strategies integrating physical, chemical, and biological data. These initiatives emphasize the role of ocean dynamics in biodiversity changes and support improved ecological assessments. PAGES will build on these foundations for more robust marine health evaluations.\nPAGES will introduce an integrated, process-based approach to enhance MSFD monitoring strategies by diagnosing biodiversity within specific ocean dynamics. Providing proof-of-concepts, PAGES aims to influence national MSFD observation frameworks, shifting from conventional sampling to process-driven monitoring. PAGES will refine baselines and provide recommendations for future iterations and more effective applications of the proposed novel approach, including the implementation in future surveys for ground truthing and/or refinement of protocols. PAGES will demonstrate how understanding environmental dynamics can simplify complexity by revealing emergent ecosystem patterns and thus contributing to a more effective, data-driven approach for assessing marine environmental status. Just like a book, a summary of the marine status can be reached by reading all its PAGES!\n\nKeywords: Good Environmental Status; Process-based monitoring; Adaptive sampling strategy; Integrated Physical Oceanography-Biodiversity; Ocean Health"

    "text": "Summary\nEutrophication is a critical issue in areas of the Northwest European Shelf and the Baltic Sea, diminishing water quality and inhibiting sustainable blue economy sectors. The challenging yet urgent need for international collaboration across the area regarding marine eutrophication is a true code blue for our seas. Information is still lacking to produce an efficient and long-lasting eutrophication policy in a changing climate based on conventions’ recommended nutrient input levels.\nCodeBlue will compile observational river data to build a unique and harmonised set of model forcing data to be used in front-line physical-biogeochemical models. CodeBlue will consider the long-term aspects of biogeochemistry cycles (e.g. sea bed nutrient storage, climate change), and the effect of nutrient transport from adjacent basins. A set of long-term model simulations (&gt;50 years) will be generated, including base line hindcasts and “what if scenarios” of low riverine nutrient load and no climate change scenarios as well as climate projections, including a nutrient scenario of “Maximum Allowable Input”. CodeBlue will use a weighted ensemble model approach to combine results and estimate uncertainties at regional scales, and aims to quantify the relative role of enhanced nutrient loads versus climate change in establishing present-day eutrophication as well as evaluate if suggested maximum input levels of nutrients will be effective in a changing climate.\n\nThe new information will be tailored in a two-way communication with key stakeholders in an active co-design board to find a way forward in eutrophication management considering environmental changes, targeting a de-eutrophied North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. In addition, the regional scenario results will be used by local models at blue pilot cases in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Western Iberia (Galicia and Sado estuary) to establish how the implemented measures will affect blue economy activities (e.g. aquaculture) and local marine management. CodeBlue has the ambition to make knowledge readily available to blue food entrepreneurs, local marine managers, scientists and policy-makers by providing innovative, user-driven, interactive visualisation tools tailored to stakeholder needs. The CodeBlue web portal will display large open access (available on EMODnet), transparent and homogenous datasets following the FAIR principles, while stakeholder involvement from start to finish will ensure applicability. Policy briefs facilitate knowledge transfer to stakeholders, while results embedded in existing structures will secure the project’s legacy in the longer term. CodeBlue is by essence a true test use case of the Digital Twin of the Ocean for the North-East Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, with results aimed at impacting policies at a regional and European Union scale, not only on eutrophication, but also to improve the overall quality of our marine waters and support sustainable blue food."

The project focuses on Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) dynamics on the Belgian Continental Shelf, examining how biological activity affects particle aggregation and settling. While SPM dynamics are primarily controlled by physical forces, biological processes play an increasingly recognized role through the production of marine gels - Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) and Coomassie Stainable Particles (CSP) - that enhance particle aggregation into faster-sinking biomineral flocs. BG-PART tests several key hypotheses about biophysical flocculation processes, including how fresh versus refractory organic matter affects aggregation differently, how cohesive and non-cohesive mineral fractions influence flocculation, and how seasonal biological cycles drive feedback loops between light availability, phytoplankton production, and sediment dynamics. The research employs a comprehensive approach combining field measurements aboard research vessels (RV Belgica), controlled laboratory experiments on phytoplankton cultures and flocculation processes, and numerical modeling to simulate the complex interactions observed in nature."

While emphasis is placed on studying their natural morphodynamic evolution, little is known about if and how fast sand waves recover after dredging. This work presents an analysis of multibeam echosounder data collected at three former sand extraction sites on the Belgian continental shelf. At one of the sites, sand waves seemed to reappear approximately 5 years after dredging had stopped, which did not happen at the other two sites during the measurement period (5 and 9 years). The lack of recovery in those sites is likely the result of larger depths and smaller local sediment availability compared with the site where recovery occurred. Furthermore, these data reveal that in the latter site sand wave recovery was established mainly through local sediment redistribution."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nNumerous fish populations show strong year-to-year variations in recruitment. The early life stages play a crucial role in determining recruitment and dispersal patterns. A helpful tool to understand recruitment and dispersal involves simulations with a Lagrangian transport model, which results from the coupling between a hydrodynamic model and an individual-based model. Larval transport models require sound knowledge of the biological processes governing larval dispersal, and they may be highly sensitive to the parameters selected. Various assumptions about larval traits, behaviour and other model parameters can be tested by comparing simulation results with field data to identify the most sensitive parameters and to improve model calibration. This study shows that biological parameterization is more important than inter-annual variability in explaining the year-to-year differences in larval recruitment of common sole in the North Sea and the eastern English Channel. In contrast, year-to-year variability of connectivity leads to higher variability than changes in the biological parameters. The most influential parameters are pelagic larval duration, spawning period and mortality. Calibration over a 12 yr recruitment survey shows that a scenario with low mortality associated with a long larval duration and behaviour involving nycthemeral and tidal migration best reproduces the observations. This research provides insights into factors influencing fish dispersal and recruitment, suggesting a strategy for enhancing the accuracy of models in upcoming studies. The study supports the improvement of larval dispersal modelling by incorporating an easily applicable sensitivity analysis for both calibration and validation. Incorporating sensitivity analyses enhances larval dispersal models, providing performing tools that can contribute to informed fisheries management and understanding of recruitment variability."

    "text": "Abstract\nPlankton, especially phytoplankton, serves as the essential building block of the marine food chain. As a result, the presence of plankton in a body of water is frequently utilized as a measure of water quality and primary productivity. This study aims to determine plankton’s spatial patterns in Northern Aceh’s waters as a bioindicator of water quality. The spatial distribution of plankton was analyzed through water sampling at several points in the sea in the Northern Waters of Aceh (NWA). Plankton analysis included abundance, diversity, and community composition. Concurrently, an analysis of environmental parameters, including temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen, was conducted. Information on plankton abundance and environmental parameters was then linked to identify their spatial relationships. Furthermore, to understand the spatial distribution of plankton, plankton abundance was correlated with spectral bands from satellite imagery. The study results indicate spatial variation in plankton abundance in NWA due to the physicochemical parameters of the seawater. Analysis reveals that Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta (diatoms), Chlorophyta, Arthropoda, and Rotifera are present in NWA, with Bacillariophyta being the most dominant. The dominance of Bacillariophyta (diatoms) over Cyanobacteria, combined with the absence of Pseudo-nitzschia spp., highlights the good ecological health and fertility of NWA."

This paper summarizes the main results of this review restricted to a sub-domain, the modelling approach of the marine eutrophication. After recalling the different aims pursued, an overview is given on the historical time course of this modelling effort, its world distribution and the various tools used. Then, the main results obtained are examined, highlighting the specific strengths and weaknesses of the present models. Needs for future improvement are then listed."

Larval dispersal patterns from spawning to nursery grounds and larval survival are driven by hydrodynamic processes and shaped by (a)biotic environmental factors. Therefore, it is important to understand the impacts of increased temperature rise and changes in wind speed and direction on larval drift and survival. We apply a particle-tracking model coupled to a 3D-hydrodynamic model of the English Channel and the North Sea to study the dispersal dynamics of the exploited flatfish (common) sole (Solea solea). We first assess model robustness and interannual variability in larval transport over the period 1995–2011. Then, using a subset of representative years (2003–2011), we investigate the impact of climate change on larval dispersal, connectivity patterns and recruitment at the nursery grounds. The impacts of five scenarios inspired by the 2040 projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are discussed and compared with interannual variability. The results suggest that 33% of the year-to-year recruitment variability is explained at a regional scale and that a 9-year period is sufficient to capture interannual variability in dispersal dynamics. In the scenario involving a temperature increase, early spawning and a wind change, the model predicts that (i) dispersal distance (+70%) and pelagic larval duration (+22%) will increase in response to the reduced temperature (−9%) experienced by early hatched larvae, (ii) larval recruitment at the nursery grounds will increase in some areas (36%) and decrease in others (−58%) and (iii) connectivity will show contrasting changes between areas. At the regional scale, our model predicts considerable changes in larval recruitment (+9%) and connectivity (retention −4% and seeding +37%) due to global change. All of these factors affect the distribution and productivity of sole and therefore the functioning of the demersal ecosystem and fisheries management."

    "text": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the influence of man-made infrastructures on fish population dynamics is an important issue for fisheries management. This is particularly the case because of the steady proliferation of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Several flatfish species are likely to be affected because areas with OWFs in place or planned for show a spatial overlap with their spawning grounds. This study focuses on six commercially important flatfish species in the North Sea: common sole (Solea solea), European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), brill (Scophtalmus rhombus), European flounder (Platichthys flesus), and common dab (Limanda limanda). We used a particle-tracking model (Larvae&Co) coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic model to assess the effects of spatial overlap of OWFs with the species’ spawning grounds on the larval fluxes to known nursery grounds. An important overlap between planned areas of OWFs and flatfish spawning grounds was detected, with a resulting proportion of settlers originating from those areas varying from 2% to 16%. Our study suggests that European plaice, common dab, and brill could be the most affected flatfish species, yet with some important local disparities across the North Sea. Consequently, the study represents a first step to quantify the potential impact of OWFs on flatfish settlement, and hence on their population dynamics."

    "text": "Abstract\nLarval dispersal and juvenile survival are crucial in determining variation in recruitment, stock size and adult distribution of commercially important fish. This study investigates the dispersal of early-life stages of common sole (Solea solea L.) in the southern North Sea, both empirically and through modeling. Age at different life-history events of juvenile flatfish sampled along the coasts of Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in 2013, 2014 and 2016, was determined through the counting of daily growth rings in the otoliths. Juveniles captured between August and October were estimated to be on average 140 days old with an average pelagic larval duration of 34 days. The hatching period was estimated between early April and mid-May followed by arrival and settlement in the nurseries between May and mid-June. Growth rates were higher off the Belgian coast than in the other nursery areas, especially in 2013, possibly due to a post-settlement differentiation. Empirical pelagic larval duration and settlement distributions were compared with the Larvae&Co larval dispersal model, which combines local hydrodynamics in the North Sea with sole larval behavior. Yearly predicted and observed settlement matched partially, but the model estimated a longer pelagic phase. The observations fitted even better with the modelled average (1995–2015) distribution curves. Aberrant results for the small juvenile sole sampled along the UK coast in March 2016, led to the hypothesis of a winter disruption in the deposition of daily growth rings, potentially related to starvation and lower food availability. The similarities between measured and modelled distribution curves cross-validated both types of estimations and accredited daily ageing of juveniles as a useful method to calibrate biophysical models and to understand early-life history of fish, both important tools in support of efficient fisheries management strategies."

    "text": "Abstract\nCoastal salt marshes and their valuable ecosystem services are vulnerable to degradation due to rising sea levels, to which they can adapt through biogeomorphic feedbacks. However, the invasion of plant species, particularly eco-engineering species that alter these interactions, may degrade the structural integrity and functionality of salt marshes, potentially reducing their resilience to sea-level rise. Such impacts presently remain poorly understood. Focusing on coastal marshes of China, we utilized a coupled biogeomorphic model to explore the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion versus native Suaeda salsa on coastal geomorphology, considering different sea-level rise and tidal scenarios. Our results revealed that Spartina alterniflora invasion contributed to the formation of a “levee-basin” geomorphological structure at both the landscape scale (from seaward to landward zones) and the local scale (from channel fringes to marsh interiors). This pattern led to a prominent marsh depression, particularly in “basin” areas under microtidal conditions, indicating increased vulnerability to rising sea levels in invaded systems. Additionally, the proliferation of Spartina alterniflora could completely displace Suaeda salsa. Our findings emphasize the importance of controlling plant invasion to safeguard ecosystem resilience to environmental change."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis study shows the effect of climate change on the growth and survival of early life history stages of common sole (Solea solea) in different nursery areas of the North Sea, by combining a larval transport model with an individual-based growth model (Dynamic Energy Budget) to assess the fate from egg to young of the year at the end of the first growth season. Three scenarios of climate change, inspired by the 2040 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections, are tested and results are compared to a reference situation representative of current climate conditions. Under climate change scenarios where wind changes, water temperature increases and earlier spawning are considered, the early arrival of fish larvae in their nurseries results in larger young of the year at the end of summer. However, early arrival leads to higher mortality due to initially slow growth in spring. Future climate scenarios result in higher biomass and reduced first-year survival. How this result translates into changes at population level and stock management needs further investigation. Nonetheless, this study illustrates that processes linking life stages are paramount to understand and predict possible consequences of future climate conditions on population dynamics."

    "text": "Abstract\nOver the last decades, nutrients loading to the sea have significantly increased due to the growing anthropogenic pressure in the river watersheds. Some areas of the English Channel and Southern Bight of the North Sea are particularly affected by the resulting eutrophication nuisances. Establishing the link between these nuisances and anthropogenic activities requires (1) the identification of the major nutrient sources and (2) the assessment of the ecosystem response to these nutrient alterations. A nutrient tracking approach has been implemented in the marine ecological model MIRO&CO to allow tracing marine nitrogen back to its continental sources over 2000–2010. On average, nitrogen atmospheric deposition contributes between 1 and 10 mmol N/m3 to marine nutrients concentrations in the English Channel and Southern Bight of the North Sea. This corresponds to relative contributions between 10 and 30%. River contributions remained localized except for the Seine and small French rivers. Different geographical patterns of sources contribution were found for wet and dry periods. Results also showed different contribution systems between offshore and coastal areas. Relative contributions from nitrogen sources to nutrients and phytoplankton biomass are similar. This study provides useful information to help identifying the causes of marine eutrophication and mitigating its nuisances."

    "text": "Abstract\nTo protect marine ecosystems threatened by climate change and anthropic stressors, it is essential to operationally monitor ocean health indicators. These are metrics synthetizing multiple marine processes relevant to the users of operational services. In this study, we assess whether selected ocean indicators simulated by operational models can be effectively constrained (i.e., controlled) by biogeochemical observations, by using a newly proposed methodological framework. The method consists in firstly screening the sensitivities of the indicators with respect to the initial conditions of the observable variables. These initial conditions are perturbed stochastically in Monte Carlo simulations of one-dimensional configurations of a multi-model ensemble. Then, the models are applied in three-dimensional ensemble assimilation experiments, where the reduction of the ensemble variance corroborates the controllability of the indicators by the observations. The method is applied to ten relevant ecosystem indicators (ranging from inorganic chemicals to plankton production), seven observation types (representing data from satellite and underwater platforms), and an ensemble of five biogeochemical models of different complexity, employed operationally by the European Copernicus Marine Service. Our results demonstrate that all the indicators are controlled by one or more types of observations. In particular, the indicators of phytoplankton phenology are controlled and improved by merged observations of surface ocean colour and chlorophyll profiles. Similar observations also control and reduce the uncertainty of the plankton community structure and production. However, we observe that the uncertainty of trophic efficiency and particulate organic carbon (POC) increases when chlorophyll-a data are assimilated. This may reflect reduced model skill, though the unavailability of relevant observations prevents a conclusive assessment. We recommend that the controllability assessment proposed here becomes a standard practice in the design of operational monitoring, reanalysis, and forecast systems. Such standardization would provide users of operational services with more accurate and precise estimates of ocean ecosystem indicators."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe present study describes the responses of summer phytoplankton biomass to changes in top-down forcing (expressed as zooplankton mortality) in three ecosystems (the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Nordic Seas) across different 3D ecosystem models. In each of the model set-ups, we applied the same changes in the magnitude of mortality (±20%) of the highest trophic zooplankton level (Z1). Model results showed overall dampened responses of phytoplankton relative to Z1 biomass. Phytoplankton responses varied depending on the food web structure and trophic coupling represented in the models. Hence, a priori model assumptions were found to influence cascades and pathways in model estimates and, thus, become highly relevant when examining ecosystem pressures such as fishing and climate change. Especially, the different roles and parameterizations of additional zooplankton groups grazed by Z1, and their importance for the outcome, emphasized the need for better calibration data. Spatial variability was high within each model indicating that physics (hydrodynamics and temperature) and nutrient dynamics also play vital roles for ecosystem responses to top-down effects. In conclusion, the model comparison indicated that changes in top-down forcing in combination with the modelled food-web structure affect summer phytoplankton biomass and, thereby, indirectly influence water quality of the systems."

The model is validated with respect to water levels, sea currents, temperature and salinity during 2017. Validation for astronomical tides showed that the model is able to simulate observed tidal elevation and phases for both diurnal and semi-diurnal principal constituents with a consistent level of agreement at measurement station. A statistical analysis of the results showed that the correlation coefficient and skill index between the modelled and observed tidal elevations are both above 0.96 with an average RMSE of 9 cm. The atmospheric contribution to water levels was also validated. In this case, we observe a good agreement between modelled and measured water levels with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 and an average RMSE of 1.23 cm. The validation of spatial distribution and vertical evolution of zonal current, salinity and temperature also indicated a high model accuracy for these variables. Overall, we show that our model of the Gulf of Guinea leads to highly accurate simulations, providing a basis for further fundamental and applied research studies in the area."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntertidal wetlands, such as mangroves in the tropics, are increasingly recognized for their role in nature-based mitigation of coastal flood risks. Yet it is still poorly understood how effective they are at attenuating the propagation of extreme sea levels through large (order of 100 km2) estuarine or deltaic systems, with complex geometry formed by networks of branching channels intertwined with mangrove and intertidal flat areas. Here, we present a delta-scale hydrodynamic modelling study, aiming to explicitly account for these complex landforms, for the case of the Guayas delta (Ecuador), the largest estuarine system on the Pacific coast of Latin America. Despite coping with data scarcity, our model accurately reproduces the observed propagation of high water levels during a spring tide. Further, based on a model sensitivity analysis, we show that high water levels are most sensitive to the mangrove platform elevation and degree of channelization but to a much lesser extent to vegetation-induced friction. Mangroves with a lower surface elevation, lower vegetation density, and higher degree of channelization all favour a more efficient flooding of the mangroves and therefore more effectively attenuate the high water levels in the deltaic channels. Our findings indicate that vast areas of channelized mangrove forests, rather than densely vegetated forests, are most effective for nature-based flood risk mitigation in a river delta."

    "text": "Abstract\nMarine eutrophication in the North-East Atlantic (NEA) strongly relies on nutrient enrichment at the river outlets, which is linked to human activities and land use in the watersheds. The question is whether human society can reduce its nutrient emissions by changing land use without compromising food security. A new version of Riverstrahler model (pyNuts-Riverstrahler) was designed to estimate the point and diffuse nutrient emissions (N, P, Si) to the rivers depending on land use in the watersheds across a large domain (Western Europe agro-food systems, waste water treatment). The loads from the river model have been used as inputs to three marine ecological models (PCOMS, ECO-MARS3D, MIRO&CO) covering together a large part of the NEA from the Iberian shelf to the Southern North Sea. The modelling of the land-ocean continuum allowed quantifying the impact of changes in land use on marine eutrophication. Pristine conditions were tested to scale the current eutrophication with respect to a “natural background” (sensu WFD), i.e. forested watersheds without any anthropogenic impact. Three scenarios representing potential management options were also tested to propose future perspectives in mitigating eutrophication. This study shows that a significant decrease in nitrogen fluxes from land to sea is possible by adapting human activities in the watersheds, preventing part of the eutrophication symptoms in the NEA rivers and adjacent coastal zones. It is also shown that any significant achievement in that direction would very likely require paradigmatic changes at social, economic and agricultural levels. This requires reshaping the connections between crop production and livestock farming, and between agriculture and local human food consumption. It also involves cultural changes such as less waste production and a shift towards lower-impact and healthier diets where half of the animal products consumption is replaced by vegetal proteins consumption, known as a demitarian diet (http://www.nine-esf.org/node/281/index.html)"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nChannel networks are key to coastal wetland functioning and resilience under climate change. Vegetation affects sediment and hydrodynamics in many different ways, which calls for a coherent framework to explain how vegetation shapes channel network geometry and functioning. Here, we introduce an idealized model that shows how coastal wetland vegetation creates more complexly branching networks by increasing the ratio of channel incision versus topographic diffusion rates, thereby amplifying the channelization feedback that recursively incises finer-scale side-channels. This complexification trend qualitatively agrees with and provides an explanation for field data presented here as well as in earlier studies. Moreover, our model demonstrates that a stronger biogeomorphic feedback leads to higher and more densely vegetated marsh platforms and more extensive drainage networks. These findings may inspire future field research by raising the hypothesis that vegetation-induced self-organization enhances the storm surge buffering capacity of coastal wetlands and their resilience under sea-level rise."

    "text": "Abstract\nPlanting has been widely adopted to battle the loss of salt marshes and to establish living shorelines. However, the drivers of success in salt marsh planting and their ecological effects are poorly understood at the global scale. Here, we assemble a global database, encompassing 22,074 observations reported in 210 studies, to examine the drivers and impacts of salt marsh planting. We show that, on average, 53% of plantings survived globally, and plant survival and growth can be enhanced by careful design of sites, species selection, and novel planted technologies. Planting enhances shoreline protection, primary productivity, soil carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and fishery production (effect sizes = 0.61, 1.55, 0.21, 0.10 and 1.01, respectively), compared with degraded wetlands. However, the ecosystem services of planted marshes, except for shoreline protection, have not yet fully recovered compared with natural wetlands (effect size = −0.25, 95% CI −0.29, −0.22). Fortunately, the levels of most ecological functions related to climate change mitigation and biodiversity increase with plantation age when compared with natural wetlands, and achieve equivalence to natural wetlands after 5–25 years. Overall, our results suggest that salt marsh planting could be used as a strategy to enhance shoreline protection, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration."

Given this strategic challenge, the community worldwide has started to develop science-based and user-oriented downstream services and applications that use ocean products as provided by forecasting systems as main input. This paper provides examples of stakeholder support tools offered by such applications and includes sea state awareness, oil spill forecasting, port services, and fishing and aquaculture. Also emphasized is the important role of ocean literacy and citizen science to increase awareness of and education about these critical topics. Snapshots of various applications in key world ocean regions, within the framework of the OceanPrediction Decade Collaborative Centre (DCC), are illustrated, with emphasis given on their level of maturity. Fully operational examples can be used as inspiration for export to other areas."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of shrimp species in the Lake Nokoué-Cotonou Channel complex for an efficient management of the fishery. The results of one year sampling from five stations (North, South, East, Central and West) in the complex revealed the following proportions: Penaeus notialis 73.68%, Macrobrachium macrobrachion 13.81%, Macrobrachium vollenhovenii 5.36%, Penaeus monodon 2.68%, Macrobrachium felicinum 2.20%, Penaeus kerathurus 1.72%, Macrobrachium cf. zariquieyi 0.27%, and Macrobrachium equidens 0.27%. The species M. cf. zariquieyi and M. equidens were never reported from Benin, but are now found in Lake Nokoué. Spatially, Penaeus (Penaeus notialis) are more abundant in the west (Acadja concentration zone), while Macrobrachium (Macrobrachium macrobrachion) are more dominant in the east (near the Ouémé entrance) and north (near the Sô entrance) of the lake. Penaeus are strongly present in the lagoon complex from January to August, while Macrobrachium are more abundant in Lake Nokoué from September to December. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that increasing salinity, pH, transparency and total dissolved solids (TDS) positively influenced the abundance of P. notialis, while increasing salinity, pH, transparency, and TDS negatively influenced the abundance of M. macrobrachion at the 5% significance level. For an efficient management of the shrimp fishery, it is desirable that the shrimp fishery in Lake Nokoué, mainly in the Cotonou Channel, which is a very sensitive area for their seasonal migrations, benefits from at least three months of respite per year, from November to January. This period corresponds to the strong migration of juvenile Penaeus towards the lake. This should allow many Penaeus to grow up and breed at least once in their lives, according to the species’ life cycle presented."

    "text": "Abstract\nDensely populated coastal river deltas are very vulnerable to compound flood risks coming from both oceanic and riverine sources. Climate change may increase these compound flood risks due to sea level rise and intensifying precipitation events. Here, we investigate to what extent nature-based flood defence strategies, through the conservation of mangroves in a tropical river delta, can contribute to mitigate the oceanic and riverine components of compound flood risks. While current knowledge of estuarine compound flood risks is mostly focussed on short-term events such as storm surges (taking 1 or a few days), longer-term events, such as El Niño events (continuing for several weeks to months) along the Pacific coast of Latin America, are less studied. Here, we present a hydrodynamic modelling study of a large river delta in Ecuador aiming to elucidate the compound effects of El Niño-driven oceanic and riverine forcing on extreme high water level propagation through the delta and, in particular, the role of mangroves in reducing the compound high water levels. Our results show that the deltaic high water level anomalies are predominantly driven by the oceanic forcing but that the riverine forcing causes the anomalies to amplify upstream. Furthermore, mangroves in the delta attenuate part of the oceanic contribution to the high water level anomalies, with the attenuating effect increasing in the landward direction, while mangroves have a negligible effect on the riverine component. These findings show that mangrove conservation and restoration programmes can contribute to nature-based mitigation, especially the oceanic component of compound flood risks in a tropical river delta."

    "text": "Summary\nEutrophication—the excessive enrichment of water with nutrients, leading to ecosystem degradation—became increasingly evident in the North Atlantic and the North Sea around 1980. In response, the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR) was established to monitor marine environmental issues and develop solutions to mitigate eutrophication and its impacts. Despite significant efforts to reduce nutrient inputs, eutrophication continues to affect large areas of these regions.\nTo support more effective assessment and management, the Intersessional Correspondence Group on Eutrophication Modelling (ICG-EMO) was created in 2005. Its goal is to provide robust model-based datasets to inform eutrophication assessments used in OSPAR’s Quality Status Report (QSR).\nECOMOD has been an active member of ICG-EMO since its inception, contributing cutting-edge ecosystem model results and participating regularly in OSPAR discussions through the group."

The group forms an important link between the biophysical modelling community that produces estimates of ecosystem components and the managers charged with giving advice on the status of those systems and their resources.\nMembers of WGIPEM identified five key topic areas at its first meeting in 2012: understanding the dynamics of primary and secondary production and the two-way coupling of lower and upper trophic level models, representing the movements of fish and other living resources, projecting the impacts of climate change and variability on the productivity and distribution of key species and the composition of foodwebs, quantifying and conveying uncertainty within various modelling approaches, and coupling novel aspects of socio-economic and ecological science within models."

    "text": "Summary\nThe Working Group on Marine Benthal and Renewable Energy Developments (WGMBRED) looks at benthal and renewable energy related research, cause-effect relationships and develops guidelines to aid future research.\nThe aim of the group is to increase scientific efficiency of benthal renewable energy related research, to specify the various cause-effect relationships resulting from the construction and operation of offshore renewable energy installations, and to develop guidelines and an overview of existing data for cumulative impact research by future international collaboration. The outcomes will assist in improving monitoring concepts in the context of offshore renewable energy constructions and will also be set within the context of marine spatial planning strategies and future ecosystem-based management approaches.\nRenewable energy developments, in particular offshore wind farms, cause large-scale anthropogenic pressures which affect benthic communities over various spatial and temporal scales within coastal and offshore ecosystems over the next decades.\nBenthic organisms have a fundamental place in marine ecosystems and deliver numerous ecosystem services (such as marine biodiversity, long-term carbon storage and natural resources), which are intimately linked to the benthic system. Extensive renewable energy developments have the potential to initiate processes which are expected to affect benthic communities in numerous ways. The identification of these processes is the prerequisite for an efficient, hypothesis-driven approach towards the understanding of the various effects of marine energy developments on the marine benthos as well as on the whole ecosystem.\nThe work group consists of scientists from many European countries and North America. WGMBRED meets annually and meetings are hosted at one of the members institute, aiming to visit a new country each year. Group members cooperate in research projects, by data exchange and in joint scientific publications."
