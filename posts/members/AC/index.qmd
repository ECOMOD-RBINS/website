## Biography

My master thesis, in physics, was an attempt to describe the behavior of cellular automata through the lens of information theory.
Since then, I have devoted myself to the study of marine ecosystems using data analysis and ecological modelling.
My PhD thesis, dedicated to the Black Sea, has been praised for its inter-disciplinarity and relevance for managerial concerns.
After a series of postdoctoral experiences in oceanography (Spain, Italy, Belgium, and France), I’m currently holding a *FedTwin* cross-insitutional postion between the academic research team [BGEOSYS](https://biogeomod.ulb.be/) at Université Libre de Bruxelles and the public research team [ECOMOD](https://ecomod.be/) at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences.
My current objective is to building a task force within and accross these teams, focused on the study of ecosystem dynamics accross the Land-Ocean Continuum ([RECAP](/projects/RECAP)).

### Marine models

Through past commitments, I had the opportunity to use and contribute to the development of a large variety of marine modelling tools addressing the hydrodynamics, benthic and pelagic biogeochemistry components, and their connection with high trophic levels and societal stakes. These models were deployed in 3D, 1D, and Lagrangian settings, to address process studies, sensitivity analyses, long-term hindcast (production and analyses), operational forecasts and downstream service production, all of which involve a specific set of validation protocols.

At ECOMOD, I now coordinate the development of the biogeochemical module of [COHERENS](/tools/COHERENS), where our first achievement has been to ensure a compatibility module between COHERENS and [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/wiki). 

At BGEOSYS, I coordinate the technical developments of [CGEM](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00216/full), a 1D estuarine model resolving the biogeochemical exchanges and transformation processes at the interface between the land and marine domains.

### Data Analysis

The conditioning, calibration, and validation of these models provided me with a good overview of the various datasets and monitoring tools relevant to marine and coastal dynamics. 
In general, I favour in my works to evidence phenomena from observations before employing models to describe underlying mechanisms.
During my PhD, while working on the simulation of Black Sea oxygen dynamics, I applied a detrending methodology (Capet et al, 2014, Ocean Science) on datasets of various nature, and revealed an impressive decline in the oxygen inventory of the Black Sea over the last decades (Capet et al, 2016, Biogeosciences).
Later, by combining model and in situ time series (1955-2020), I related this trend to a warming-induced shift in the ventilation regime of the Black Sea (Capet et al. 2020, Biogeosciences).
From these works, I proposed an [Ocean Monitoring Index](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/ocean-monitoring-indicators/black-sea-oxygen-trend-observations-reprocessing) to keep track of this trend for the Copernicus Marine Service. During the master thesis of my colleague [Florian Ricour](/posts/members/FR), we used BGC-Argo to characterise the morphology of the Deep-Chlorophyll Maximum in the Black Sea (Ricour, Capet, et al., Biogeosciences, 2021)

Besides, I was introduced to remote-sensing altimetry and oceanic mesoscale dynamics during my first postdoc (IMEDEA, Spain; Capet, et al. 2014, Geophysical Research Letters).
More recently, in the frame of an ESA project, I have combined altimetry and Argo profiles to assess the subsurface oxygen imprint of Black Sea (Capet, et al. 2022).

In an ongoing framework set in Lake Nokoue, Benin, we attempt to use in-situ species characterization of phytoplancton groups with multi and hyper spectral ocean color datasets, to infer the spatial and seasonal distribution of toxic algaes, and provide managment support for this ecosystem.

### Coastal oceanography

My concern for societal issues quickly draw me to the coastal environment that concentrates high stakes and dependencies, and its specific modelling challenges.
A clear limitation of marine models appeared when addressing benthic hypoxia in coastal shelves (Capet et al. 2014, Biogeosciences): too often, the representation of dissolved and particulate fluxes at the sediment-water interface largely over-simplify diagenetic processes.
After having implemented an efficient approach towards benthic dynamics in the Black Sea (Capet et al, 2016, Ocean Modelling), I obtained a Marie-Curie grant (OGS, Italy) for application
in the Mediterranean Sea and joined with Pr. K. Soetaert (NIOZ, the Netherlands) to automatize the calibration of diagenetic models. I then applied this method to relate sediment core data to functional ‘facies’ of benthic communities. These facies provided a convenient way to introduce spatial variation of bioturbation (solid-phase mixing induced by dwelling) and bioirrigation (dissolved exchanges induced by ventilation) in coupled models. Benthic-pelagic coupling remains an active research line, now oriented to North Sea sediments and the challenge of deriving a umbrella modelling framework adequate for both permeable and non-permeable sediments.  

An important part of my activities in the North Sea gravitates around offshore renewable energies, which started for me with FACE-IT (2016-20), where I co-supervised a PhD evaluating the impact of offshore windfarms on sediment dynamics in the North Sea.
Since then, I've joined the ICES Working Group on Marine and Benthal Renewable Developments [ICES_WGMBRED](/activities/working-groups/ICES_WGMBRED/), suggsting ways to progress on the question “How do Offshore wind farms impact coastal ecosystem services”. I proposed a semi-quantitative framework to synthesise expert opinions on the links between pressures, organisms, functions, and services ([Diamond Diagram](https://fricour.shinyapps.io/owidex/)). I'm now active with different degrees of involvement in  RBINS research  dedicated to the environmental impact of solar and wind offshore renewable energy (MarineSPOTS, [ECOMPV](/projects/ECOMPV), [SWIM](/projects/SWIM)), most often with colleagues from [MARECO](https://mareco-odnature.naturalsciences.be/).

### Applied and operational oceanography

I've for long be in touch with the Copernicus Marine Service community, among others through the Marine Forecasting Center for the Black Sea, that was ensured by my former group at ULiège.  
In 2018, I joined the foundation of the EuroGOOS Coastal Working Group ([CWG](https://eurogoos.eu/coastal-wg/), which I now co-chair with G. El Serafy), and conducted the first systematic survey questioning the capacity of European operational models towards coastal phenomena (Capet et al, 2020, Frontiers in Marine Science). The CWG now collaborates with the OceanForecast Decade Collaborative Center, to pursue this exercice in the frame of their [Atlas of Ocean Operational Forecasting Systems](https://www.unoceanprediction.org/en/atlas).
