## DISARM - Dumpsites of munitions: Integrated Science Approach to Risk and Management

January 2020 - December 2023

## Summary

**The [DISARM](https://www.disarm.be/) project developed an integrated scientific approach to support risk assessment and management of the Paardenmarkt marine munition dumpsite.** 
The Paardenmarkt is one of the many munition dumpsites in our oceans. A few meter below the current seafloor, ca. 35.000 tons of WW1 chemical and conventional munition are buried. The present scientific knowledge is insufficient to make any reliable judgement on the state of the site. The DISARM project aims to address the knowledge gaps, but will go an important step further to develop an integrated scientific approach to support risk assessment and management of marine chemical munition dumpsites worldwide, using the Paardenmarkt munition dumpsite as a challenging case study.
