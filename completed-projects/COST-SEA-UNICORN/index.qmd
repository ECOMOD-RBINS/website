## [COST-SEA-UNICORN](https://www.sea-unicorn.com/) - Unifying Approaches to Marine Connectivity for improved Resource Management for the Seas

September 2020 - September 2024

## Summary

SEA-UNICORN brings together a broad, inter-disciplinary community of scientists, marine stakeholders and policy-makers, from more than 100 organizations spread around the world, in order to advance knowledge and unify concepts and approaches in the emerging field of Marine Functional Connectivity (MFC). SEA-UNICORN scientists will share their complementary expertise to identify knowledge gaps in the field of MFC, and integrate information gained from a wide range of tools such as genetics, remote sensing / telemetry, morphological analyses, and dispersal modelling. Inputs from theoreticians, ecosystem modellers, and conservation scientists, but also from marine policy-makers and resource or ecosystem managers in the network, will also contribute to advance concepts and methods in MFC science. Our common aim is to improve knowledge on MFC and facilitate the incorporation of MFC data into the projection models and decision support tools used for decision-taking in marine policy and management.
