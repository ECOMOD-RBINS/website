## ZERO-IMPACT - Automatic monitoring of biodiversity in the North Sea using eDNA

September 2021 - November 2023

## Summary

ZERO-IMPACT aims to develop an innovative, sustainable and automatic method to detect marine species based on ‘environmental’ DNA (eDNA). The project is a methodological study that is hands-on with concrete applications for biodiversity monitoring, marine fisheries and aquaculture, in particular:
- supporting stock estimates of commercial fish species
- more accurate delineation of spawning periods of commercial fish species and splash fall periods of marine animals
- detection of toxic algae and harmful parasites in relation to marine shellfish culture
- monitoring biodiversity (animals and phytoplankton) in support of science and policy (achieving Good Environmental Status according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, Directive 2008/56 /EC) and Natura 2000 conservation objectives)

Studying marine species and biodiversity using eDNA is complementary to traditional methods and at the same time offers huge advantages: 1/ by collecting water to detect the presence of species, the organisms themselves are not disturbed or killed, 2/ studying different organisms (fish, invertebrates, plankton) can be done based on only one sampling method and 3/ continuous time series for marine biodiversity and fish populations can be obtained through automatic sampling of seawater.
