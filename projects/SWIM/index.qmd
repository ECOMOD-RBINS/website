## SWiM - Solar and WInd energy in the Belgian Marine zone

November 2024 - October 2026

## Summary

The aim of [SWiM](https://www.swimproject.be/) is to conduct research on the combination of marine technologies in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Belgium, in particular to integrate Offshore Floating Photovoltaics (OFPV) in wind farms. The six partners of SWiM will model the performance as a function of environmental variables, assess the limits to electricity generation imposed by the cables to shore, work out criteria for the mooring and anchoring, define rules for the placement and evaluate potential environmental impacts. Workshops with stakeholders will be held to derive policy advice.
