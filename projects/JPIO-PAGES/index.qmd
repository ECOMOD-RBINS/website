## JPIO-PAGES - Process-based Assessment for the Good Environmental Status

September 2025 - August 2028

## Summary

Understanding marine ecosystem impacts amid complex ocean dynamics is vital for monitoring ocean health but remains challenging. The EU's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) promotes a coordinated, precautionary approach to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) using 11 ecosystem descriptors. Traditional linear and threshold-based assessments have proven insufficient. Recent efforts like the S4GES (2022) and BIOTREC-Tara (2024) cruises tested innovative, process-based, multi-platform monitoring strategies integrating physical, chemical, and biological data. These initiatives emphasize the role of ocean dynamics in biodiversity changes and support improved ecological assessments. PAGES will build on these foundations for more robust marine health evaluations.

**PAGES** will introduce an integrated, process-based approach to enhance MSFD monitoring strategies by diagnosing biodiversity within specific ocean dynamics. Providing proof-of-concepts, PAGES aims to influence national MSFD observation frameworks, shifting from conventional sampling to process-driven monitoring. PAGES will refine baselines and provide recommendations for future iterations and more effective applications of the proposed novel approach, including the implementation in future surveys for ground truthing and/or refinement of protocols. PAGES will demonstrate how understanding environmental dynamics can simplify complexity by revealing emergent ecosystem patterns and thus contributing to a more effective, data-driven approach for assessing marine environmental status. Just like a book, a summary of the marine status can be reached by reading all its PAGES!

## ECOMOD tasks and responsabilities

Modelling eDNA transport
Lagrangian transport modelling will be used to predict origin and dispersal of eDNA and hence provide a more realistic interpretation of eDNA data.
