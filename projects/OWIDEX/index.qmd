## OWIDEX - Offshore Wind Decommissioning Expertise Centre

2023-2025

## Summary

From [MARECO](https://mareco-odnature.naturalsciences.be/project/owidex/). Belgium is among the world leaders in the installation & maintenance of offshore wind farms. The decommissioning of the first offshore wind turbines is in sight. The knowledge already acquired about the decom value chain is fragmented, making a supported vision seem far away. This project will put all the separate elements together & is the kickstart of a long-term cooperation between knowledge, government institutions & companies. Here, experience, knowledge & research are bundled, visualised & disseminated, providing policy & industry with an expertise platform.
