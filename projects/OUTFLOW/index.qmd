## OUTFLOW - Quantifying the cOntribUTion of Fouling fauna to the Local carbon budget of an Offshore Wind farm

November 2024 - October 2026

## Summary

OUTFLOW will investigate how ocean sprawl, currently much related to the installation of offshore 
wind farms (OWFs), affects the organic matter (OM) dynamics at the local and regional scale. While 
OWFs are installed in an attempt to combat climate change (Priority 2), the presence of OWFs 
affects the potential of the local environment to support and preserve life (i.e. habitability) through 
the replacement of mobile sands with artificial hard structures resulting in the loss of habitat for 
soft-sediment organisms and gain for fouling organisms. The presence of the fouling fauna leads 
to a functional shift towards suspension feeding organisms and a subsequent alteration of the 
interactions between species and their environment (Priority 1), affecting carbon and nitrogen 
(Priority 1) cycling pathways. The fouling fauna filters a significant amount of water in search of 
food, hereby secreting faecal pellets (FP), which are deposited on the surrounding sea floor. 
Locally, this leads to imbalances in biogeochemical cycles (Priority 2) in the sediment, and altered 
faunal communities, to such extent that the altered sediments can act as a carbon sink (Priority 3) contributing
as Blue Carbon reservoirs to mitigating climate change (Priority 2). Given the 
increasing effort to install OWFs in coastal areas in Europe and beyond, assessing cumulative 
effects on the ecological integrity (Priority 1) of the marine ecosystem at the regional scale 
requires upscaling of local changes to geographical scales that are relevant for managerial 
purposes.

## ECOMOD tasks and responsabilities

- **Task 5.1** Gathering forcing data for the biogeochemical model.

The upscaling will require the collection of the necessary underlying data for the modelling, and 
will be done by re-using own data, by harvesting data from publicly available databases, data 
available through D.4.1.1 or model simulations. Deliverable 5.1.1. will be a collection of supporting 
data for further modelling efforts.

- **Task 5.2** Upscaling at the North Sea scale

Based on D.5.1.1, D.3.2.1. and data collected during Task 1.1., a spatial upscaling to the North Sea 
scale will be done by updating the biogeochemical model MIRO&CO to include filtration rates and 
FP production by the fouling fauna. The spatial information needed to run scenarios (gridded maps 
on OWF location with relevant information on future turbine dimensions and decommissioning 
scenarios) will be produced. Deliverable 5.2.1. will be an updated version of MIRO & CO (Month 
45); D.5.2.2. comprises the gridded maps underpinning the scenario runs.

- **Task 5.3** Simulations

Based on the updated MIRO & CO version (D.5.2.1) and the relevant spatial information (D.5.2.2.), 
the possible redistribution of OM at the scale of the North Sea will be estimated. In addition, taking 
into account the data on Blue Carbon potential generated through D.4.2.1, the Blue Carbon 
potential of the North Sea sediments will be assessed. Deliverable 5.3.3. will be a mapping of the 
rearrangement of sedimentary carbon pools at the scale of the North Sea, as a consequence of the 
current and expected OWFs and different decommissioning scenarios.
