## EcoMPV - Eco-designing Marine PhotoVoltaic installations

December 2022 - November 2025

## Summary

EcoMPV will deepen the knowledge about environmental challenges related to offshore PV 
installations, aiming at technical solutions to mitigate undesired consequences and maximize 
beneficial impacts. We will address knowledge gaps about (1) altered underwater light field, 
hydrodynamics, pelagic biogeochemistry and primary production, (2) the artificial habitat provision 
for colonizing fauna and fish, and (3) effects on carbon fluxes and sequestration. Advice for 
ecodesigning offshore PV installations, paving the way to its environmental licensing, will be 
formulated.

## Team members involved

Arthur Capet, Pauline Denis and Florian Ricour
