# Marine Ecosystem Modelling (ECOMOD)

:::: columns
::: {.column style="width:50%; margin-right: 20px; font-size: 20px;  text-align: justify"}
[**ECOMOD**](team.qmd) is an interdisciplinary team composed of scientists with diverse backgrounds (mechanical engineer, bioengineer, oceanographers, mathematicians, physicists, evolutionary biologist), and expertise in hydrodynamics, sediment transport, biogeochemistry, ecosystem modelling, biophysical modelling, and Individual-Based Modelling.

ECOMOD is part of the [ECODAM](https://www.naturalsciences.be/nl/wetenschap/onderzoek/research-teams/ecosystems-data-processing-and-modelling-ecodam) (Ecosystems, data processing and modelling) group of the Operational Directorate Natural Environment ([OD Nature](https://odnature.naturalsciences.be/home/)) within the Institute of Natural Sciences.

To achieve our goals, we are developing and using different types of models (hydrodynamics, sediments, biogeochemical, particle transport, contaminants), codes and softwares:

::: {.column style="width:50%; text-align: justify;  font-size: 20px"}
-   ECOMOD is responsible for the **development, upgrading and maintenance** of the RBINS Research Infrastructure [**COHERENS**](posts/projects/COHERENS) modelling system, which is publicly available.

-   ECOMOD also **developed codes and softwares** that are publicly available:
    -   [**Demeter**](https://github.com/ogourgue/demeter): The Multiscale biogeomorphic modeling framework
    -   [**TidalGeoPro**](https://github.com/ogourgue/tidalgeopro): A Python package to analyze geometric and hydraulic properties of tidal channels
    -   [**VFC**](https://github.com/ogourgue/vfc): A vegetation/Flow Convolution Python module
    -   [**UVPec**](https://pypi.org/project/uvpec/): Underwater Vision Profiler Embedded Classifier

-   ECOMOD is **using modelling tools** such as [**Parcels**](https://oceanparcels.org/index.html), for particle tracking simulations.

<!-- ### To Update (simplify text & include it in the different tabs) - Need pictures representing different applications with self-explaining captions

The marine models are used to:

-   Ensure sustainable use of marine resources<br />
    *Fisheries, aquaculture*

-   Ensure sustainable ecosystem and biodiversity<br />
    *Assessing environmental status, ecological disturbance of Invasive species*

-   Assess risks/pollution and identify pollution sources<br />
    *Eutrophication (including transboundary nutrient transport and tagging), chemicals, plastics*

-   Assess the impact of anthropogenic pressure<br /> *Climate change, land-sea continuum of eutrophication, acidification, sea level rise, introduction of hard structures (offshore wind farms, offshore floating photovoltaics, measuring platforms, artificial islands…)*

-   Testing management options, advising on mitigation scenarios<br />
    *Oyster bed restoration, river loads reduction scenarios, monitoring options (reduce costs)*
