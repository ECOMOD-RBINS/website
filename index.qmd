# Marine Ecosystem Modelling (ECOMOD)

::::: columns
::: {.column style="width:50%; margin-right: 20px; font-size: 20px;  text-align: justify"}
[**ECOMOD**](team.qmd) is an interdisciplinary team composed of scientists with diverse backgrounds (mechanical engineer, bioengineer, oceanographers, mathematicians, physicists, evolutionary biologist), and expertise in hydrodynamics, sediment transport, biogeochemistry, ecosystem modelling, biophysical modelling, and Individual-Based Modelling.

ECOMOD is part of the [ECODAM](https://www.naturalsciences.be/nl/wetenschap/onderzoek/research-teams/ecosystems-data-processing-and-modelling-ecodam) (Ecosystems, data processing and modelling) group of the Operational Directorate Natural Environment ([OD Nature](https://odnature.naturalsciences.be/home/)) within the Institute of Natural Sciences.

<b>ECOMOD focuses on aquatic ecosystems and how these relate to societal matters and has a strong expretise in the development and use of marine ecosystems modelling tools to support the management of the marine environment, particularly for Belgian waters, but also the Southern Ocean, Benin and Vietnam.</b>

## ![](images/homepage/Picto_Mission.png){height="50"} Our mission

::: large-text
-   Improve scientific knowledge in marine ecosystems through interdisciplinary research

-   Support and advise stakeholders

-   Disseminate science and raise public awareness

-   Develop open-source numerical models and community tools

-   Manage RBINS' Research Infrastructure COHERENS
:::


## ![](images/homepage/tools.png){height="40"} Modelling tools

::: large-text
To achieve our goals, we are developing and using different types of models (hydrodynamics, sediments, biogeochemical, particle transport, contaminants), codes and softwares:
:::


-   ECOMOD is responsible for the **development, upgrading and maintenance** of the RBINS Research Infrastructure [**COHERENS**](posts/projects/COHERENS) modelling system, which is publicly available.

-   ECOMOD also **developed codes and softwares** that are publicly available:

    -   [**Demeter**](https://github.com/ogourgue/demeter): The Multiscale biogeomorphic modeling framework
    -   [**TidalGeoPro**](https://github.com/ogourgue/tidalgeopro): A Python package to analyze geometric and hydraulic properties of tidal channels
    -   [**VFC**](https://github.com/ogourgue/vfc): A vegetation/Flow Convolution Python module
    -   [**UVPec**](https://pypi.org/project/uvpec/): Underwater Vision Profiler Embedded Classifier

-   ECOMOD is **using modelling tools** such as [**Parcels**](https://oceanparcels.org/index.html), for particle tracking simulations.

## ![](images/homepage/applications.png){height="50"} Domain of expertise and applications

```{=html}
<!-- ### To Update (simplify text & include it in the different tabs) - Need pictures representing different applications with self-explaining captions

The marine models are used to:

-   Ensure sustainable use of marine resources<br />
    *Fisheries, aquaculture*

-   Ensure sustainable ecosystem and biodiversity<br />
    *Assessing environmental status, ecological disturbance of Invasive species*

-   Assess risks/pollution and identify pollution sources<br />
    *Eutrophication (including transboundary nutrient transport and tagging), chemicals, plastics*

-   Assess the impact of anthropogenic pressure<br /> *Climate change, land-sea continuum of eutrophication, acidification, sea level rise, introduction of hard structures (offshore wind farms, offshore floating photovoltaics, measuring platforms, artificial islands…)*

-   Testing management options, advising on mitigation scenarios<br />
    *Oyster bed restoration, river loads reduction scenarios, monitoring options (reduce costs)*
