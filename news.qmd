# ECOMOD latest updates

## September 2025
### Another award for ECOMOD (Sep, 24)
Pauline had the opportunity to take part in a pitch contest (3 minutes, 1 slide) during the Belgian Offshore Wind PhD Day in Ghent. The event, organized by the [OWI Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/owi-academy/posts/?feedView=all) from [OWI-lab](https://www.owi-lab.be/), brought together PhD students working in the field of offshore wind energy. Pauline presented her PhD project titled “Wind, Sea & Sun”, focusing on modelling the impacts of floating solar panels co-located with offshore wind farms, and won one of the pitch contest sessions. Congratulations!

### Kick-off meeting PAGES (Sep, 24 - 25)
The kick-off meeting of [PAGES](/projects/JPIO-PAGES/) took place at [JPIOceans](https://www.jpi-oceans.eu/en/pages-project-kicks-shape-future-marine-monitoring), marking the official start of this project. The project aims to represent a significant advancement in marine environmental assessment, addressing knowledge gaps for the implementation of the [Marine Strategy Framework Directive](/activities/reporting/MSFD/), which requires EU member states to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) in their marine environments. Léo and Geneviève are part of the project and will mainly work on eDNA.

### ICES Annual Science Conference (Sep, 15 - 18)
Pauline and Arthur attended the ICES Annual Science Conference in Klaipeda, Lithuania. It was a great opportunity to see relevant presentations, reconnect with international peers, network, and take part in several workshops. As part of the [ECOMPV](/projects/ECOMPV/) and [SWiM](/projects/SWIM/) projects, Pauline presented a poster on the biogeochemical impact modelling of floating solar panels in a Belgian offshore wind farm using a 1D setup.

### "Ecosystems in a Changing World" Conference (Sep, 8 - 10)
The "Ecosystems in a Changing World" conference was jointly organized in Brussels by the Royal Academy for Overseas Sciences, the [Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences](https://www.naturalsciences.be/), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This event explored critical themes such as climate change, biodiversity, ecological restoration, and sustainable development, featuring insights from international experts. The program covered diverse topics, including industrial ecosystems, ocean management, desertification, digital innovations, and collaborative research, while also offering networking opportunities and visits to the RBINS museum. On September 9, RBINS hosted the conference, where Stéphanie delivered a presentation titled: "Numerical models to assess the effects of anthropic pressures on marine ecosystems”. Her talk highlighted the applications of the COHERENS model in understanding and mitigating human impacts on marine environments. Thanks Stéphanie for representing us!

### New ECOMOD paper! (Sep, 3)
Pooran Khedri, Sebastiaan van de Velde (both former ECOMOD members), and Olivier Gourgue have published a new study that assesses the impact of bottom trawling in Northwest European waters. Their findings suggest that this practice releases approximately 270,000 tons of carbon annually by disturbing seafloor sediments. However, the actual extent of this impact remains highly uncertain.

### FishBase-SeaLifeBase Symposium (Sep, 1 - 3)
This year, [RBINS](https://www.naturalsciences.be/) hosted the "23rd [FishBase](www.fishbase.org)-[SeaLifeBase](www.sealifebase.org) Symposium", bringing together leading scientists to discuss the latest research on fish and marine biodiversity. This 2025 hybrid edition gathered around 100 participants in Brussels and 150 online and featured talks spanning a wide range of topics, from taxonomy to genetics, from local studies to global ecosystem models, and from fundamental science and paleontology to applied conservation.This event has highlighted the diversity of fish and marine life research, and the collaborative spirit of the FishBase/SealifeBase consortium. ECOMOD was part of the organisation (Geneviève, Léo, Valérie). Geneviève had the opportunity to give a talk on "Integrating FishBase and SeaLifeBase in marine ecosystem models" and showed many modelling applications of the team.

## May 2025
### Liège colloquium (May, 26 - May, 30)

This year's [56th Liège Colloquium](https://www.ocean-colloquium.uliege.be/cms/c_14229949/en/international-liege-colloquium-on-ocean-dynamics?id=c_14229949&id=c_14229949) focused on Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal. Marine-based CDR techniques are gaining attention to achieve the CO2 removal necessary for climate stabilisation. The colloquium brought together experts from diverse disciplines to discuss marine CDR approaches' potential, feasibility, efficiency, risks, and the need for adequate monitoring and policy regulations. Arthur presented, as a co-author; a poster made by Keziah Pepiette and Sandra Arndt (ULB) exploring the response of benthic biogeochemistry to scenario of olivine enrichement, which is perceived as a technically tractable mean to enhance ocean alkalinity, and increase mare CO2 uptake.

### Maria's 3-month Visit (March - May)

Maria Pedreros, originally from Chile, returned to Brussels for the second time to work with us as she finalizes the last phase of her PhD. Maria adapted the ocean-based [COHERENS](/tools/COHERENS/) model to simulate how seasonal temperature variations affect Chile’s Lake Lanalhue. Despite challenges like coarse weather data and necessary lake-specific adjustments, the model successfully captured the lake’s real-life patterns of stratifying in summer and mixing in winter. Great work, Maria!

### Press release of Olivier's work (Apr, 17)

Saltmarshes are among nature’s best defenses against rising sea levels, acting as natural barriers that protect coastlines. New research shows that dense vegetation on saltmarshes makes them more vulnerable to sea level rise because the vegetation hinders sediment transport. A surprising twist, as it was believed that dense vegetation played a crucial role in helping these ecosystems survive.
