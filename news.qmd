# ECOMOD latest updates

## September 2025
### "Ecosystems in a Changing World" Conference (Sep, 8 - 10)
The "Ecosystems in a Changing World" conference was jointly organized in Brussels by the Royal Academy for Overseas Sciences, the [Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences](https://www.naturalsciences.be/), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This event explored critical themes such as climate change, biodiversity, ecological restoration, and sustainable development, featuring insights from international experts. The program covered diverse topics, including industrial ecosystems, ocean management, desertification, digital innovations, and collaborative research, while also offering networking opportunities and visits to the RBINS museum. On September 9, RBINS hosted the conference, where Stéphanie delivered a presentation titled: "Numerical models to assess the effects of anthropic pressures on marine ecosystems”. Her talk highlighted the applications of the COHERENS model in understanding and mitigating human impacts on marine environments. Thanks Stéphanie for representing us!

### FishBase-SeaLifeBase Symposium (Sep, 1 - 3)
This year, [RBINS](https://www.naturalsciences.be/) hosted the "23rd [FishBase](www.fishbase.org)-[SeaLifeBase](www.sealifebase.org) Symposium", bringing together leading scientists to discuss the latest research on fish and marine biodiversity. This 2025 hybrid edition gathered around 100 participants in Brussels and 150 online and featured talks spanning a wide range of topics, from taxonomy to genetics, from local studies to global ecosystem models, and from fundamental science and paleontology to applied conservation.This event has highlighted the diversity of fish and marine life research, and the collaborative spirit of the FishBase/SealifeBase consortium. ECOMOD was part of the organisation (Geneviève, Léo, Valérie). Geneviève had the opportunity to give a talk on "Integrating FishBase and SeaLifeBase in marine ecosystem models" and showed many modelling applications of the team.

## May 2025
### Liège colloquium (May, 26 - May, 30)

This year's [56th Liège Colloquium](https://www.ocean-colloquium.uliege.be/cms/c_14229949/en/international-liege-colloquium-on-ocean-dynamics?id=c_14229949&id=c_14229949) focused on Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal. Marine-based CDR techniques are gaining attention to achieve the CO2 removal necessary for climate stabilisation. The colloquium brought together experts from diverse disciplines to discuss marine CDR approaches' potential, feasibility, efficiency, risks, and the need for adequate monitoring and policy regulations. Arthur presented, as a co-author; a poster made by Keziah Pepiette and Sandra Arndt (ULB) exploring the response of benthic biogeochemistry to scenario of olivine enrichement, which is perceived as a technically tractable mean to enhance ocean alkalinity, and increase mare CO2 uptake.

### EuroGOOS General Assembly (May, 19 - May, 21)

EuroGOOS held it's [2025 General Assembly](https://eurogoos.eu/download/2025-eurogoos-ga-doc-1-1-agenda/?wpdmdl=15015&refresh=68413e24ca86b1749106212) this 19-21 May 2025 in Helsinky. Arthur Capet took part, as co-chair of the Coastal Working Group, and to present recent analyses of the OceanPrediction [Atlas](https://www.unoceanprediction.org/en/atlas/models). 127 European operational ocean forecasting systems are already represented!

### North Sea Working Group (May, 1)

During the last EGU Conference, ECOMOD colleagues and other scientists came together to initiate the creation of a North Sea Working Group. The aim is to strengthen networking across North Sea institutes, build consortia, share data and knowledge, and develop collaborative initiatives. Stay tuned!

### Maria's 3-month Visit (March - May)

Maria Pedreros, originally from Chile, returned to Brussels for the second time to work with us as she finalizes the last phase of her PhD. Maria adapted the ocean-based [COHERENS](/tools/COHERENS/) model to simulate how seasonal temperature variations affect Chile’s Lake Lanalhue. Despite challenges like coarse weather data and necessary lake-specific adjustments, the model successfully captured the lake’s real-life patterns of stratifying in summer and mixing in winter. Great work, Maria!

### Policy brief CLIMDIS (Apr, 30)

The [Policy Brief](https://cebios.naturalsciences.be/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/280425_template_A4_IMER_PB.pdf) on the use of COHERENS to model scenarios to safeguard Halong Bay waters has been released. This Policy brief, which is an outcome of the project [CLIMDIS](/completed-projects/CLIMDIS/) funded by [BELSPO](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/coordination/doc/biCoop/CLIMDIS_en.pdf), has been designed in collaboration with [CEBioS](https://cebios.naturalsciences.be/) (Capacities for Biodiversity and Sustainable Development) program.

### Press release of Olivier's work (Apr, 17)

Saltmarshes are among nature’s best defenses against rising sea levels, acting as natural barriers that protect coastlines. New research shows that dense vegetation on saltmarshes makes them more vulnerable to sea level rise because the vegetation hinders sediment transport. A surprising twist, as it was believed that dense vegetation played a crucial role in helping these ecosystems survive.
