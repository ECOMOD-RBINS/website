Needed:

- VScode or another IDE that works with quarto (RStudio, Positron)
- In VScode (and Positron), you need to install the [extension for quarto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto)
- need to install the following quarto extension (in your terminal):
  - `quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome`
 
How to (needs to be improved...)

- [Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) on building a quarto website
- `_quarto.yml` defines the base structure of the website.
- When you have made some changes, you can execute `quarto preview` in your terminal to preview your changes, it will open a localhost:port that you can view on your favorite web browser. Note that you can also preview your changes directly inside VScode, depending on your specific configuration.
  - When in preview mode, your changes are automatically re-rendered when saving the latter (not for all changes, e.g. changes made to `_quarto.yml` but any changes in .qmd files will be re-rendered live). 
- Before deploying your website (i.e. in our case, pushing changes on the git repo), execute `quarto render`

##### Add a new project

Go to `/posts/projects/` and create a new folder with a file called `index.qmd`. This file should starts with some YAML metadata style code (between --- YAML DATA ---). Below this, just write some markdown and you're good to go.

##### Add a new activities

Same thing as for the project section but in `posts/activities`

##### When you push on the repo

In order for the website to run, we need the HTML code so the `docs` folder needs to be pushed (will be updated after rendering) as well as your local changes.
